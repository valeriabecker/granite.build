        """Stamp started_at/finished_at on a step or target run for a transition.

        Mutates ``stored_run`` in place based on its CURRENT (pre-transition)
        status and the incoming ``new_status``; the caller updates
        ``stored_run.status`` afterward. Shared by the step-run and target-run
        status handlers so both obey identical transition rules.

        started_at is stamped on the FIRST entry into RUNNING, regardless of the
        prior status. Keying off "was PENDING" would drop started_at on a
        non-linear first transition -- e.g. a target run created SUBMITTED (with
        started_at still None) that goes straight to RUNNING. The
        started_at-is-None guard alone provides the "first entry" semantics: a run
        can legitimately re-enter RUNNING (the Lsf monitor reports PENDING while a
        bsub job is queued or suspended, then RUNNING again once LSF dispatches or
        resumes it), and the guard keeps that from pushing started_at later than
        the run actually began.

        finished_at is stamped on the FIRST entry into any terminal status
        (``Status.is_finished()``), regardless of the prior status. Keying off
        "was RUNNING" was wrong in both directions: a RUNNING -> PENDING transition
        (a queued or suspended scheduler job) must NOT be marked finished, and a
        run that terminates straight from a PENDING-mapped state must still be
        marked finished -- e.g. the Lsf monitor reports PENDING for a suspended job
        (PSUSP/SSUSP/USUSP/UNKWN), the job is then killed while suspended, and the
        terminal FAILED arrives from PENDING rather than RUNNING. The
        finished_at-is-None guard keeps a redelivered terminal event from
        overwriting the original timestamp.

        :param stored_run: The step or target run to mutate; its ``status`` field
            still holds the pre-transition status.
        :param new_status: The status arriving with this event.
        :param timestamp: The event timestamp to record.
