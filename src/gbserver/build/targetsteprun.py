    Mirrors how steps resolve (``space://steps/<name>`` → a directory containing
    ``step.yaml``): ``space://monitors/<name>`` resolves — via the space
    resolver — to a directory whose ``monitor.yaml`` holds the monitor. The
    shipped ``builtins/monitors/`` tree is a base URI (the default); a
    configurations-level ``monitors/`` tree overrides by name. A monitor.yaml
    has the same ``{type, ref, config}`` shape as a :class:`StepMonitorConfig`,
    so a monitor may itself reference a parent monitor.

    The resolved directory is materialized locally via :class:`Asset` (the same
    fetch path steps use), so a monitor ref works for every space backend that
    steps support — including git-hosted spaces, whose base URI resolves to a
    ``git+ssh://`` / ``git://`` URI rather than a local ``file://`` path.

    Threading / event loop: this resolves ``space://`` against **thread-local**
    ``SpaceURI.base_uris`` (and uses the thread-local cache below), so it must run
    on the per-build thread and is intentionally **not** offloaded to a worker
    thread — a worker would lack that space context. For a git-backed space the
    ``Asset.sync()`` clone blocks that (event-loop) thread, exactly as the
    step.yaml materialization in :class:`Step` and the ``copytree``/template work
    in ``TargetStepRun.__init__`` already do. In practice the run-time resolves are
    cache hits: ``Build.__validate_step_monitors`` pre-resolves every step's
    monitors during ``__setup`` on this same thread (build creation), warming the
    cache. The only cold clone on the loop is a resume (validation skipped) with a
    git-backed monitor *override*; local ``builtins/monitors/*`` refs are a cheap
    file copy.
