    script's CWD (``$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR``), giving implicit per-target isolation.

    On the LSF/enroot backend the shared ``/proj`` tree is bind-mounted identity

    or unexpected state. The prefix is prepended ahead of each body's own
    ``set -eu``, so without this the body's flags would not yet be in effect while
    the prefix runs.

    When a ``build_workdir`` was provisioned (the env configures
    ``shared_workdir``), the snippet also emits ``mkdir -p`` + ``cd
    "$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR"`` so both the ``setup`` and ``run`` scripts start in that
    per-run workdir. Making the launcher own the ``cd`` lets step authors write
    outputs with relative paths and stay agnostic about where the step runs: they
    never need to reference ``$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR`` themselves. With ``set -eu`` in
    front, a failing ``mkdir``/``cd`` (or an unset ``$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR``) aborts
    fast instead of leaving the body running in the wrong directory.

    When no ``build_workdir`` is set (envs without ``shared_workdir``), no ``cd``

        On a retry (RetryHandler tears the cluster down then relaunches the same

        relaunch can fail with "Failed to acquire resources". Rather than fail the

        terminal no-retry verdict it raises and completes first, so the verdict
        surfaces promptly (the cancelled poll never hangs on its deferred

        SUCCESS or a retry handoff (``stop_event`` set by ``retry_workload``),
        and the monitor awaits the relaunch and re-polls the fresh cluster.

        the handler's budget. When no handler exists (no strategies), the poll
