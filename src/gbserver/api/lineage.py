    One entry point so a caller asks however it holds the artifact rather than the
    index dictating a lookup shape:

    - ``uri`` -- that artifact's lineage, up and down. Any spelling: a browser URL
      and the runtime's own URI normalize to one artifact.
    - ``job_id`` -- seeded from every endpoint of that execution.
    - both -- the union of their seeds.
    - neither -- the most recent lineage activity, capped.

    Unlike ``POST /artifact`` this returns the node/edge graph directly, with a
    ``depth`` per node, instead of re-projecting it into run-centred entries. It also
    never 404s: an empty graph means "nothing recorded", which is a real answer, and a
    caller must not render it as an error.

    There is no ``build_id`` filter. The index has no such column -- a build is a
    granite.build process concept, absent from every imported row -- and a
    build-scoped view goes through ``POST /build``, which resolves the build outside
    the index and seeds this same walk.

    Only the database-backed provider can answer this: the external backends have no
    such query, so this reports 501 rather than inventing an empty answer.

    **The graph is cross-space and is NOT filtered per space.** That is deliberate,
    and it is the one design decision here worth stating twice.

    A lineage graph carries no access to anything: it holds artifact URIs, job names
    and edges. Reading a model, pulling a dataset or fetching a step config each needs
    its own authorized call, none of which route through here.

    Filtering it would break the question lineage exists to answer. A chain almost
    always crosses spaces -- a shared curated dataset, a platform-team base model --
    so pruning nodes from spaces the caller cannot read makes "what was my model
    trained on?" silently unanswerable: the graph would look complete while stopping
    at the space boundary. A truthful partial answer is not available here, only a
    misleading one.

    The accepted cost: artifact URIs and job names are visible across spaces. That is
    broader than ``GET /artifacts/``, which narrows to the caller's spaces via
    ``scope_space_name_filter``. Provenance is judged worth that asymmetry -- so if
    an artifact URI or a job name is ever itself a secret, this route is the wrong
    place to keep it.
