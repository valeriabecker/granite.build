"""Path resolution and auth helpers for the build-files REST API.

Path math is delegated to gbserver.environment.lsf_paths so the REST API and
the LSF build runtime stay in sync.

SECURITY: every remote path that enters a shell command or SFTP call MUST
pass through validate_subpath(). Do not concatenate user-supplied segments
onto the build root yourself.
