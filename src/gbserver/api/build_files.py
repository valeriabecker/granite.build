"""REST endpoints for inspecting an LSF build's remote-file outputs.

Three endpoints, registered on the shared builds_api:
  - GET /builds/{id}/files          — directory listing (optional substring filter)
  - GET /builds/{id}/files/search   — recursive content grep
  - GET /builds/{id}/file/download  — streamed file bytes (capped large)

Path resolution: ``path`` is relative to the build root
(``{workspace_remote_dir}/llm-build-{build_id}``).

Auth matches PUT /builds/{id}/update (owner or space/super admin).
Every user-supplied path passes through validate_subpath() and then
resolve_and_check_real_path() before it hits a shell or SFTP call — do
not bypass those helpers.
