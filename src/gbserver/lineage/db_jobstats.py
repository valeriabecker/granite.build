"""The sink that writes lineage into the local index.

The write half of the lineage index: ``DBLineageService`` reads the table, this
fills it. Same ``ILineageStore`` interface the W&B sink implements, so the
reconciler and the watcher drive it unchanged.

**The job entries are not built here.** ``create_jobstats_for_target`` in
``wandb_jobstats`` already turns a target run into job entries -- resolving input
and output artifacts, collecting step configs, redacting secret-named keys -- and
``_add_jobstats_mirror_fields`` already exposes them as top-level
``sources``/``targets``, which is exactly the shape ``to_lineage_rows`` consumes.
Reusing it means the two sinks cannot disagree about what a build's lineage *is*;
re-deriving it here would fork that logic and let them drift. Only the module
functions are reused, never ``WandBLineageStore`` itself, so nothing here needs
``wandb`` installed or configured.

What this sink adds is the decomposition: one job entry with N inputs and M
outputs becomes N*M flat rows sharing a ``job_id``. That is lossy only in
appearance -- ``group_by_job`` recovers which inputs and which outputs an
execution had -- and it is what makes each row an independently indexable edge.

Dedup is by presence of ``target_run_uuid``, not by row count. A target either has
its rows or it does not. It deliberately does not compare against the reconciler's
``expected_counts``, which counts one W&B run per output artifact: that number
never equals an N*M row count, so comparing would report every target as
unrecorded forever and re-record on every scan.
