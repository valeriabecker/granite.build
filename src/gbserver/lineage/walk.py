"""Level-order traversal of the lineage graph.

One query per level, batched over an indexed text column, identical on SQLite and
Postgres. The traversal runs here rather than in SQL because there is no raw-SQL
seam to run a ``WITH RECURSIVE`` through -- ``get_by_where``'s string branch
raises ``NotImplementedError`` -- and because a Python walk needs no per-dialect
SQL.

Breadth-first is not an implementation detail: it is what makes the depth reported
for a node the length of its *shortest* path. The recursive SQL this replaces gets
the same result by grouping on ``max(depth)``/``min(depth)`` after the fact.
