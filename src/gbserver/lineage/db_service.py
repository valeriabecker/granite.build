"""Serve artifact lineage out of the local index instead of W&B.

``POST /lineage/artifact`` delegates to a :class:`LineageService` and returns 404
when that service returns ``None`` -- which is what ``NoopLineageService`` does for
everything, so standalone shows "Lineage is not available" for every artifact
today. This implementation answers the same question from the lineage table, so a
deployment with no W&B still has lineage.

Only the graph is implemented here. The event-emission and tag-search methods of
the interface belong to the W&B-shaped write path (this service reads an index
another writer populates), so they are explicit no-ops rather than pretending to
succeed -- see each method for why its degenerate value is the safe one.

Root resolution is the part worth reading. The request identifies an artifact the
way a UI can -- a name, or a URL -- while the index is keyed by canonical
identifier. Rather than reconstruct an identifier from a name (which cannot be done:
the identifier needs a namespace and a type the request does not carry), the lookup
goes the other way and matches against what rows already store. That makes lineage
imported from a source with no uuid reachable, which was the point of keying the
index by identifier in the first place.

        It is deliberately not answered from the index here: this service is the
        *read* side, and the sink that writes rows does its own presence-based
        dedup against the same table (``get_recorded_target_runs``). Answering here
        too would put the same decision in two places, keyed differently -- target
        id here versus target run uuid there -- and the two would disagree.
