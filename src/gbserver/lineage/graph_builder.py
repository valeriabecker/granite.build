"""Turn walked lineage rows into the graph dict the API already speaks.

The read path's shape is not ours to choose: ``api/lineage.get_artifact_graph``
consumes ``{root_id, nodes, edges, truncated}`` with artifact and run nodes and
directed edges between them, and re-projects that into the run-centred
``ArtifactGraphResponse`` the frontend renders. Serving the index through the same
dict is what lets a second provider land with no frontend change.

The shape conversion is the real work here, because the storage model and the wire
model disagree about what a node is. A stored row is one flat
``(source, job_id, target)`` triple -- the job is a *column*, not a node. The wire
graph is **bipartite**: artifacts and runs are both nodes, and every edge joins one
of each (``artifact -> run`` for a consumed input, ``run -> artifact`` for a
produced output). So one row expands into up to two edges through a shared run
node, and the rows of one ``job_id`` converge on that single run node -- which is
what reassembles the N*M decomposition into "this execution had these inputs and
these outputs".

Terminals do not become nodes. A creation row's source and a deletion row's target
are the empty marker, identifying no artifact; each contributes only the half-edge
it does have. Emitting a node for them would collapse every creation in the graph
into one shared "nothing" node.

    Args:
        graph: the walk result, as returned by
            :func:`~gbserver.lineage.walk.walk_lineage`.
        root_uri: the normalized URI the graph is *about*. It becomes ``root_id``,
            because a node's URI is its identity -- there is no separate identifier
            to reconcile it against any more.
        root_is_artifact: whether ``root_uri`` names an artifact. ``False`` for a
            build-seeded graph, which has several roots and no single one to flag:
            nothing is marked ``is_root`` and no node is synthesized. Defaulting
            this to ``True`` would mint a bogus artifact node named after the build.

    Returns:
        ``{root_id, nodes, edges, truncated}``. An empty artifact graph yields the
        root node alone with no edges: "nothing recorded" is a real answer and must
        not read as an error.

    **Self-loops are collapsed.** A row whose source equals its target is an in-place
    rewrite -- an append to a dataset, a table refreshed in place -- and real data is
    full of them: 30.4% of an imported Lakehouse graph, with one dataset appended
    68,905 times. Rendering one run node per such row produced a 55 MB response
    describing a single artifact.

    Collapsing costs nothing in reachability, which is what makes it safe to do here
    rather than as a cap: the traversal already refuses to chain *through* a self-loop
    (see :func:`~gbserver.lineage.walk._walk_one_direction`), so those runs expand no
    frontier and reach no artifact the graph would otherwise miss. They are pure
    volume.

    The collapsed node keeps a ``run_count`` and the id of one representative run, and
    the full list stays available from ``GET /lineage/runs?uri=...`` -- indexed, paged,
    and never truncated. Nothing is lost, only moved off the graph response.
