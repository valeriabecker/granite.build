        Bounded to the given candidates (queried against the backing store's run
        metadata), so a recorder skips re-emitting targets this backend already
        has without scanning its whole history. Idempotent recording keeps
        correctness regardless; this is purely an efficiency optimization, so on
        any failure implementations should return ``target_ids`` unchanged
        (re-recording the candidates, a harmless no-op) rather than raise.

        ``expected_counts`` maps a target uuid to the number of runs a *fully*
        recorded target should have, so a target that recorded only some of its
        runs on a prior crashed scan is still reported unrecorded (and thus
        re-recorded) rather than being masked by a single present run. ``None``
        or a missing key falls back to the presence check (recorded once >=1 run
