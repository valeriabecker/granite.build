"""Admin-DB reconciliation for centralized lineage recording.

The admin DB already holds the complete lineage graph: every successful target
run and its input/output artifacts are persisted to admin storage during the
build. ``WandBLineageStore.add_jobstats_for_build_target`` reconstructs a
target's lineage purely from ``storage.target_storage`` — no build events are
involved. So the full lineage for granite.build is recoverable by re-reading the
admin DB alone.

This module makes that reconstruction the *central* recording mechanism, rather
than driving recording off the (in-memory, restart-blind) event stream:

- ``record_target_lineage`` is the single idempotent leaf: "record this one
  (build, target)". Everything that records lineage goes through it — the
  reconciliation scan below, and (later) a manual/CLI selector for pushing
  selected build lineage to the store, with no rework.
- ``reconcile_once`` is the central selector: it scans the admin DB for
  successful target runs and feeds each through the leaf.

Idempotency is what makes a full rescan safe: the underlying store records with
deterministic runIds + ``resume="allow"`` + content-dedupe, so re-recording an
already-recorded target is harmless. Because the scan re-derives the recordable
set from the DB on every pass, a target that succeeded while the recorder was
down is picked up on the next scan — there is no restart blind spot.

    A target is recordable once it has completed successfully; its lineage is

    grows without bound over the platform's lifetime, so this never materializes
    all of it in steady state. Targets are fetched newest-``finished_at``-first
    and the walk stops as soon as it crosses ``finished_after``:

    - ``finished_after=None`` (startup / full catch-up): page through every
      successful target so anything that finished while the recorder was down is
      picked up. Recording is idempotent, so re-reading already-recorded targets

    - ``finished_after=<watermark>`` (steady state): return only targets that

      first target that is not newer than the watermark — so a steady-state scan
      reads only the new rows (typically a partial first page), never the whole
      table, regardless of how many builds have accumulated.

    The comparison is ``>=`` (not ``>``) so the boundary target is re-included
    rather than dropped; idempotent recording makes the re-read harmless and the
    caller's watermark advances past it. Targets with no ``finished_at`` are
    skipped (they are not yet complete) but do not stop the walk — a NULL row

    Two independent mechanisms bound the work and keep it sink-neutral:

    - ``finished_after`` is a *time watermark* on the target itself (not on any

      admin DB regardless of how many builds have accumulated. It says nothing
      about whether a given sink has recorded a target.
    - ``store.filter_unrecorded`` is the *per-sink* recorded-state check: each
      sink owns its own record of what it has already recorded, so the same
      admin DB can feed W&B and other sinks independently. It never raises; on
      failure it returns the full candidate set, degrading to re-recording
      (harmless — recording is idempotent). It is given each candidate's expected
      run count (``_expected_run_count``) so a target whose runs were only
      partially emitted on a prior crashed scan is reported unrecorded and
      re-recorded, rather than masked by its already-present runs.

        store: The lineage store to record into.
        storage: Admin storage to reconcile from.
        finished_after: Only consider targets that finished at or after this
            time. ``None`` (startup / restart) considers every successful target

            the next scan.
        on_success: Optional callback ``(build_id, target_id)`` invoked when a
            target records successfully, so the caller can clear any retry state
            it was tracking for that target (a target that failed a prior scan
            and then succeeds is only reported here — it drops out of the
            unrecorded set, so ``on_error`` is never called for it again).
        skip: Target uuids the caller has given up on (e.g. dropped after
            exhausting retries). These are excluded from recording so a
            persistently failing target — which still falls within the watermark
            window every scan — cannot wedge the scan. They still count toward
            the returned watermark so it can advance past them.
