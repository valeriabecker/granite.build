        Each sink owns its own record of what it has already recorded, so the
        shared admin DB can feed W&B and other sinks independently — no per-sink
        "recorded" bit lives in the admin schema. The reconciler passes the
        candidate target uuids selected by the time watermark and records only
        the returned subset, so a sink never re-emits a target it already has
        while a *different* sink can still record the same target.

        Bounded by ``target_ids`` (the candidates from this scan), so it never
        scans the sink's entire history. This is an efficiency optimization only
        — idempotent recording preserves correctness regardless — so
        implementations must never raise; on failure they return ``target_ids``
        unchanged, degrading to re-recording the candidates (harmless).

        ``expected_counts`` maps a target uuid to the number of records the sink
        should hold for a *fully* recorded target (one W&B run per output
        artifact, or 1 for an output-less target). A single target can emit
        several records, and if a prior scan crashed part-way through it, the
        sink holds *some* of them — a "recorded" check that only tests presence
        would wrongly mark such a target complete and never re-record the
        missing records, leaving a permanent partial-lineage gap. So a target is
        treated as recorded only when its held-record count meets or exceeds its
        expected count. When ``expected_counts`` is ``None`` or lacks a target's
        key (e.g. the reconciler could not derive it), that target falls back to
        the presence check (recorded once >=1 record exists) — the pre-count
        behavior, which stays correct for older records that predate this check.

        Defaults to returning ``target_ids`` unchanged for backends that record
        no centralized lineage (e.g. the no-op store); such a store's recording
        leaf is itself a no-op, so the returned set is never actually recorded.
