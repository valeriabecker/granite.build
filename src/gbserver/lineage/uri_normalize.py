"""Normalize an artifact URI into a stable lineage identity.

The lineage index keys nodes by URI: two rows describe the same artifact exactly
when their ``source``/``target`` strings are equal. So every raw spelling of one
artifact has to converge here, and -- far more importantly -- two spellings of
*different* artifacts must never converge. A missed merge shows up as two
disconnected subgraphs, which is visible and fixable; a wrong merge invents
provenance, and someone concludes a model was trained on data it never saw.

That asymmetry is why this module is conservative: it applies only per-scheme
rules that are grounded in the URI handlers under :mod:`gbcommon.uri`, and it
returns ``""`` -- never a guess -- for anything it does not recognize.

Why not just ``str(URI.get_uri(raw))``:

- :meth:`URI.get_uri` runs the string through ``fill_template`` with the
  thread-local space config (``uri.py``), so it is not a pure function of its
  argument. Lineage identity must not depend on ambient state.
- Only ``HfURI``, ``EnvURI`` and ``MemURI`` define ``custom_str``; for every
  other scheme ``str()`` is the raw ``geturl()``, which normalizes nothing.
- ``LhURI.__init__`` *rewrites* the URI it is given (injecting a default
  revision) and raises on inputs this function must simply decline.

So the dispatch is explicit, and it borrows the handlers' logic only where that
logic is a pure string transform.

       ``granite-dot-build`` to a model/fileset URI that omits its

       a URI whose namespace or table merely contains ``granite-dot-build``

       addition is what makes both spellings converge regardless.

       collapses any legacy hostname to ``staging``/``prod``, but only when
