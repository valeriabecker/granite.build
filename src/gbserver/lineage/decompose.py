"""Decompose a job into flat lineage rows.

One job execution becomes a set of ``(source, job_id, target)`` triples. The
``job_id`` on every row is what keeps the decomposition lossless: a job with N
inputs and one output (or one input and M outputs) emits max(N, M) rows, and
grouping those rows back by ``job_id`` recovers the original input and output
sets. Without it the flattening would dissolve the grouping, and "each input
produced each output" would be an unrecoverable claim rather than a projection.

The guard in :func:`to_lineage_rows` keeps a job from having more than one of
both, so the pairing is never a true cartesian product.

This is deliberately generic -- the input is a plain dict, not a granite.build
type -- because the same function serves the build sink and the future importers
of Lakehouse/dmf-ng/W&B lineage. Nothing here imports storage or granite.build
models.

An endpoint is the artifact's **normalized URI**, so a producer only has to record
a URI to be understood; there is no per-source identity translation to supply.

Ported from ``prototype-lineage-py`` (``lineage/decompose.py``, in turn
``NewStatsInput.getLineageRecords``), including its N*M guard -- see
:func:`to_lineage_rows`.

    Raises:
        LineageDecomposeError: if ``job_id`` is missing or empty, if the job has
            neither sources nor targets (there is no lineage to record), or if it
            has more than one of both (see the guard below).

    Ported from the prototype: a job with ``len(sources) > 1 and
    len(targets) > 1`` is rejected, so every accepted job -- and therefore every
    stored row -- satisfies ``min(#sources, #targets) <= 1``.

    granite.build's own producers already satisfy this, because ``wandb_jobstats``
    emits one event per output artifact rather than one per target run. The guard
    is here for the generic entry point: an importer with genuinely N*M records
    must split them into one job per target before calling this, keeping a
    distinct job identity per piece, rather than relax the guard.

    Do NOT make this function auto-split such a job to avoid raising. That was
    tried and reverted, because it trades a visible refusal for a silently wrong
    graph: the run node is derived from ``job_id``
    (``graph_builder.py``, :func:`_run_node_id`), so giving the pieces distinct
    ids makes ONE execution render as TWO run nodes, and nothing in a row can put
    them back together. The edges survive but the execution does not, which is a
    worse failure than the caller getting an error it can act on. A caller holding
    an N*M record must decide how to attribute it -- this function cannot decide
    for it without inventing provenance.
