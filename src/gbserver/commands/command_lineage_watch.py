"""``gbserver lineage-watch`` — the centralized lineage recording process.

Runs the LineageWatcher, which periodically reconciles the admin DB into the
configured lineage store (see ``lineage_reconciler`` / ``lineage_watcher``).
Deployed as its own single-replica pod (``dep-lineage-watcher.yaml``) so the
single-writer guarantee is a deployment fact and lineage recording is isolated
from the build watcher's failure domain, restarts, and resource contention.

``--base-build-id`` is optional. Without it the watcher reads the ``gb_kv_pairs``
checkpoint and, when the key is absent, records nothing until it is seeded. With
it, an *absent* key is seeded before the first scan, so a fresh deployment does
not need a separate exec/init-container step just to become useful. It never
overwrites an existing checkpoint, which is what makes it safe to leave in a pod
spec across restarts.
