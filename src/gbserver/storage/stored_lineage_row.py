"""Storage model for one flat lineage row.

A row is a ``(source, job_id, target)`` triple where the two endpoints are
**normalized URIs**. The URI is the identity: two rows describe the same artifact
exactly when their endpoint strings are equal, which is what lets lineage from a
source with no per-artifact uuid (Lakehouse, dmf-ng) be a first-class citizen
instead of something an alias table has to compensate for.

The graph has no node table. Its nodes are the distinct ``source``/``target``
values, and the traversal walks by matching one row's endpoint against another's
-- which is why those two columns are indexed.

Everything that is not needed to *find* a row lives in :attr:`attributes`, the
JSON blob. The blob is ``Text`` and therefore neither queryable nor indexable, so
the split is exactly "what a query filters on" versus "what a response carries".

**Nothing here is specific to granite.build.** A row is a job and two artifacts,
which is all any lineage source has; there is deliberately no ``build_id`` or
``target_run_uuid`` column, because a build and a target run are granite.build's
process concepts and every imported source leaves them empty -- an indexed column
that is blank on most rows indexes nothing. Lakehouse, for instance, has a job id
and no notion of either. Callers that need a process-scoped view resolve that
scope in their own system first and seed the walk with the URIs it produced, so
the index only ever answers one question: what is the lineage of this artifact.

That also means ``job_id`` carries the whole burden of "which rows were written
together": it is the only identifier every source has by definition, so it is what
the sink's dedup asks about.

# Terminal marker for source/target. NOT NULL: in SQL, NULL never equals NULL, so
# NULL endpoints would slip past the (job_id, source, target) unique index and
# leave creation/deletion rows -- the least visible ones -- as the only rows a
# re-ingest could duplicate. The traversal runs in Python and the unique key
# exists, so the sentinel costs nothing: the walk stops on a falsy endpoint
# exactly as it would on None.
#
# This is also what ``normalize_uri`` returns for a URI it cannot identify, and
# the coincidence is deliberate: "no artifact on this side" and "no identifiable
# artifact on this side" must both terminate a path rather than mint a node that
# silently fails to merge.

# get 1024: both of these are indexed AND both sit in the

# bytes. Widening them makes that index larger still, and
# ``__create_unique_indexes`` only *warns* when an index cannot be created -- so
# an over-wide column would not fail loudly, it would silently cost the unique
# index, and with it re-ingest idempotence.
#
# It is wider than the generic 256 a promoted string column gets because real
# artifact URIs have already overrun that: a Lakehouse dataset name long enough to
# pass 256 on its own has been observed (a red-teaming dataset whose name repeats
# as its table name).
#
# A URI longer than this is DROPPED rather than truncated. The column truncates
# silently, and two distinct artifacts sharing a long prefix would then collapse
# into one graph node -- provenance invented where nobody can see it. Losing a node
# is visible and fixable; that is not.
