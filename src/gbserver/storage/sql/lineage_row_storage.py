    """SQL-based storage implementation for lineage rows.

    Schema decisions, and why each column is indexed:

    - ``source`` / ``target`` carry the graph traversal. Every hop is
      ``WHERE source IN (frontier)`` or ``WHERE target IN (frontier)``, so without
      these two indexes a walk degrades to a full scan per level. They hold
      normalized URIs, which is also what makes the *root* lookup an index seek:
      a request names an artifact by URI, so there is finally something indexed to
      match it against.
    - ``job_id`` groups the rows of one execution, which is what makes an N*M
      decomposition regroupable, and it also backs the sink's presence-based dedup,
      run on every scan. The prototype joins and groups on it but leaves it
      unindexed -- a gap corrected here.

    There is deliberately no ``build_id`` or ``target_run_uuid`` column. Those are
    granite.build's process concepts, empty on every imported row, so indexing them
    would index blanks for most of the table. A caller wanting a process-scoped view
    resolves that scope in its own system and seeds the walk with the resulting
    URIs, which keeps this index answering exactly one question: what is the lineage
    of this artifact.

    Every indexed column is text. ``get_by_where`` builds an ``IN`` clause only for
    string-typed columns and silently degrades to ``column == [list]`` otherwise, so
    a non-text indexed column is a latent wrong-results bug rather than merely a
    slow one. ``source_system`` lives in the JSON blob rather than in a column: it is
    read to label a run node, never to filter one.
