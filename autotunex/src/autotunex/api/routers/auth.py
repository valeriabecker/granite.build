"""Backend-for-frontend: browser sessions via W3ID authorization code + PKCE.

Stateless by design. ``state`` and the PKCE verifier live in a short-lived
signed cookie set by ``/login`` — never server memory, so this behaves
identically behind any number of uvicorn workers. ``client_secret`` is used
only in the server-side token exchange in ``/callback`` and never reaches
the browser.

Mounted unconditionally in ``main.py``, whether or not ``"session"`` is an
enabled provider: a 404-vs-401 difference here would let a caller probe which
providers a deployment has configured, so "not configured" has to look
*exactly* like "rejected" (``SECURITY.md`` records the same reasoning for the
unconditional OpenAPI security schemes). Both routes fail closed, but not
identically: most rejections in each raise the same opaque
``InvalidCredentialsError`` a genuinely wrong credential gets, but
``/callback`` delegates ID-token verification to ``OidcBearerVerifier``, which
raises the sibling ``ExpiredCredentialsError`` instead for an expired ID
token — a different detail and a different ``WWW-Authenticate``
``error_description``. Not exploitable (an attacker cannot make the
operator's own token endpoint hand back an expired ID token), just worth
knowing the failure shape is not perfectly uniform.

Every rejection below is logged — at WARNING, except the one case that is
routine and self-correcting (an expired flow cookie), which is INFO — so an
operator can tell causes apart even though every caller sees the same opaque
body. Nothing caller-influenced (credential, cookie value, token fragment,
``state``, ``code``, email) ever reaches a log line.
