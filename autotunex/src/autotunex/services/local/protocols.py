"""Seams and value objects for the in-process ``local`` job runner.

This is the ``local`` analogue of ``services/launch/protocols.py``: it declares
the frozen context assembled from a job's persisted data (:class:`LocalRunContext`),
the two Protocol seams the runner depends on (:class:`LocalTrainer` and
:class:`TrialSink`), the log value object the sink transports
(:class:`LogRecord`), and the reward-function injection helper
(:func:`inject_reward_function`).

The seams are ``typing.Protocol`` rather than ABCs so a test double needs no base
class while mypy still checks it structurally — the same dependency-inversion
shape used across the codebase.
