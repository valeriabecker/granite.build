"""The in-process ``local`` job runner.

:class:`LocalJobRunner` is the ``local`` analogue of
:class:`~autotunex.services.runner.InProcessJobRunner`: ``submit`` schedules
``process`` as a background task and returns immediately, and ``process`` opens
its own sessions (the request session is long closed) and is directly awaitable
so tests are deterministic.

Unlike the granite.build path, this runner executes the HPO pipeline itself, on
this process, via the :class:`~autotunex.services.local.protocols.LocalTrainer`
seam. The trainer is CPU/GPU-bound and synchronous, so ``process`` runs it under
:func:`asyncio.to_thread` — which frees the event loop to service the DB writes
the trainer drives through :class:`~autotunex.services.local.sink.DbTrialSink`
from that worker thread. A run therefore does move the job's status: ``pending
→ running`` before the trainer starts, then ``running → completed`` on success
or ``running → error`` on any failure, with still-``running`` trials swept to
``error`` so none is left dangling.
