"""The persisting ``TrialSink`` and its log handler for the ``local`` runner.

:class:`DbTrialSink` bridges the **worker-thread** calls a Ray callback makes
(``trial_started`` / ``trial_result`` / ``trial_completed`` / ``trial_error`` /
``log``) to the async write repositories running on the application's event loop,
using :func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. :class:`SinkLogHandler` is a
``logging.Handler`` that buffers captured log lines and flushes them to a
:class:`~autotunex.services.local.protocols.TrialSink` in batches, so log
capture does not cost one DB round-trip per line.

**Load-bearing invariant:** :class:`DbTrialSink` is used **only from worker
threads**. Each public method blocks on ``run_coroutine_threadsafe(...).result()``
until the DB write commits; calling it on the event loop's own thread would
schedule the coroutine behind the very ``result()`` that is blocking that thread,
and deadlock. Job-level writes that happen on the loop (inside the runner's
``process()``) must call the async repositories directly, never through the sink.

      primitive — e.g. ``numpy.int64``, which is *not* an ``int`` subclass) is
      unwrapped to that primitive, so an integer hyperparameter keeps its value
      rather than being stringified away;
    * anything still unserializable (the searcher / scheduler instances) collapses
