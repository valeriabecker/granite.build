"""List a job's downloadable output files from its artifact source.

The ``ArtifactLister`` seam extends the storage layer (open decision 4) with a
read-only "list the files at this location" capability used by the
result-report endpoint. Each backend takes a source-specific ``location`` — a
filesystem path, or an ``owner/repo`` id — and returns
:class:`~autotunex.models.asset.AssetSummary` records. Scheme parsing of the
stored ``artifact_uri`` happens once, in
:func:`autotunex.services.storage.registry.resolve_artifact_lister`, so a lister
never sees a raw URI.
