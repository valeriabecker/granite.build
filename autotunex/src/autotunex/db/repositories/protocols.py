        The lookup is case-insensitive regardless of database dialect — a
        contract implementations must uphold, not merely a MySQL default.

        Multiplicity is equally part of the contract, and the case-insensitivity
        above is what makes it reachable: exactly one row, or none. An
        implementation that matches several must raise rather than guess. The
        matched rows can carry different ``role`` values, so choosing between
        them would settle whether the caller is an admin by row order — and it
        would bury the real problem. Duplicate case-variant emails are a data bug
        in the deployment (``users.email UNIQUE`` is case-sensitive on SQLite and
        Postgres), and failing closed is what makes that bug visible.

        Raises:
            AmbiguousIdentityError: several rows matched ``email``.
