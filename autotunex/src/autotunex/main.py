DESCRIPTION = """
Automated fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization for large language models.

A **job** is one optimization run. It searches a hyperparameter space by running
**trials**, each testing one concrete parameter assignment, and reports the
metrics its objective is scored on.

Jobs are created either by submitting them through this API with `POST /jobs`
or by the tuning pipeline writing to the database directly; `GET /jobs` and
`GET /jobs/{id}` report what exists, and `DELETE /jobs/{id}` removes a job.

    pydantic-settings reads ``.env`` only into ``AUTOTUNEX_``-prefixed Settings
    fields, so the raw credential vars the ``llmb`` CLI needs — ``GB_TOKEN`` (which
    authenticates the CLI) and ``HF_TOKEN`` (the HuggingFace push destination) —
    never reach ``os.environ`` from ``.env`` alone, yet the storage backends read
    them from ``os.environ``. Load them here with ``setdefault`` so a real exported
    variable always wins and the token *values* still never enter ``Settings``.

    This runs from the lifespan hook (uvicorn startup). It is a hard no-op under
    pytest: a developer's real ``.env`` must never leak ``AUTOTUNEX_*`` or
    credential vars into ``os.environ`` for the test session — and some tests drive
    ``lifespan`` directly (see ``tests/api/test_app_wiring.py``), so the usual
