"""Dataset schemas.

A *dataset* is a named reference to training data. Unlike a job (read-only) this
resource has full CRUD plus a file upload, mirroring the Configuration
endpoints. Server-owned fields — ``status``, ``artifact_id``, ``artifact_url``,
the generated ``train_file``/``validation_file`` — are absent from
:class:`DatasetCreate`: a client names and describes a dataset and picks a
format, and everything else is set by the service, the upload runner, or the
database. In particular ``artifact_url`` being server-only closes the old repo's
caller-settable-``artifact_url`` hole.
