        Mirrors ``_validate_llm``'s fail-fast stance: a launcher with no image,
        trainer repo, output root, ``gb_server_url``, or the ``gb_token_env``
        environment variable would otherwise fail on the first submitted job (or,
        for the token, on the reconcile loop's first sweep), far from the
        misconfiguration.

        Three shapes, keyed on ``job_backend`` (and, for ``llmb``, on
        ``gb_environment``):

        - ``none`` and ``local`` require nothing. ``local`` runs the ``autotune``
          HPO in-process; whether that package is installed is a *runtime* concern
          (a clear error when it is selected and absent), not a startup gate, so a
          ``local``-configured deployment without ``autotune`` still starts.
        - ``llmb`` with ``gb_environment="standalone"`` (the local-bash variant)
          drops the custom_code-only inputs (``job_runtime_image``,
          ``job_trainer_repo``, ``job_output_uri_root``); none are *required*. The
          bash spec anchors its run output under ``artifact_dir`` (as an absolute
          ``file://`` URI), not ``job_output_uri_root`` — the bash environment only
          writes ``file://``. It still requires ``gb_server_url`` (the reconcile loop
          polls the local gbserver) and still honours the ``gb_token_env`` presence check.
        - ``llmb`` with ``gb_environment="standalone"`` **and** ``lsf_cluster`` set
          (the LSF/SkyPilot variant) additionally requires ``lsf_environment_uri``,
          ``lsf_image`` and ``job_trainer_repo``.
        - ``llmb`` otherwise (custom_code) keeps the full required set, unchanged.
