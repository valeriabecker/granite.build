"""Stand up a multi-node Ray cluster inside a single LSF allocation via blaunch.

The expected flow is:

    1. The user submits ``main.py`` via ``bsub`` requesting **N GPU hosts**
       in one allocation (``-R "span[hosts=N]"``). The driver process lands
       on the first allocated host.
    2. ``main.py`` calls :func:`start_multinode_ray_cluster_blaunch`, which:
        - reads the LSF host list (``LSB_DJOB_HOSTFILE`` / ``LSB_HOSTS``)
        - starts ``ray start --head`` on the current host (CPU-only,
          schedules nothing)
        - starts a Ray worker on the **head host** directly via
          ``subprocess.Popen`` (no blaunch needed — we are already there)
          which registers that host's GPUs
        - blaunches a Ray worker on each of the other ``N-1`` allocated
          hosts so that all ``N`` hosts contribute their GPUs to the cluster
        - waits until Ray sees all expected GPUs and worker nodes
    3. ``main.py`` runs HPO / training as usual against the cluster.
    4. On exit, :func:`autotune.lsf.ray_down.stop_multinode_ray_cluster`
       tears the cluster down (no ``bkill`` of separate worker jobs needed —
       LSF's RES tears down blaunch'd children when the outer job exits).

Bringing the whole cluster up inside one allocation means a single queue
wait covering every host, at the cost of some CPU contention between the
head and the colocated worker on the first host.

    """Bring up a Ray cluster inside a single LSF allocation via blaunch.

    This does not submit any separate worker ``bsub`` jobs. It assumes the
    caller is already running inside a multi-host LSF allocation
    (``-R "span[hosts=N]"``) and starts:

      * ``ray start --head`` on the current host (CPU-only).
      * One Ray worker on the current host directly (no blaunch — registers
        this host's GPUs).
      * One Ray worker on each of the other allocated hosts via ``blaunch``.

    The handle returned has the same shape as the bsub-path handle so
    :func:`autotune.lsf.ray_down.stop_multinode_ray_cluster` works for both,
    with two additions:

      * ``worker_job_ids`` is always ``[]`` (there are no separate LSF jobs).
      * ``worker_hosts`` lists all N hosts running a Ray worker (head host
        first), and ``worker_pids`` lists the corresponding PIDs.

    Args:
        num_workers: number of GPU worker nodes (one per allocated host).
            Must equal the number of hosts in the LSF allocation.
        gpus_per_worker: GPUs per host (each host registers this many GPUs
            with Ray).
        conda_env: conda env path/name workers must activate before
            ``ray start``.
        cores_per_worker: cores reserved by each Ray worker (default 32).
            Note: on the head host, the Ray head process itself competes
            for cores with the colocated worker; size accordingly.
        fleet: name of the deployment fleet (e.g. ``"a100"``,
            ``"h100"``). Selects the default ``NCCL_IB_HCA`` rail list via
            ``_default_ib_hca(fleet)`` and the GPU model string (logged only)
            via ``_gpu_model_for_fleet(fleet)``. Default ``DEFAULT_FLEET``.
        ib_hca: explicit override for ``NCCL_IB_HCA`` (e.g. ``"mlx5_0,mlx5_1"``).
            ``None`` means "use the fleet default."
        ib_ifname: optional override for ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``. See
            ``_rdma_env``.
        wait_timeout_s: cap on the wait-for-workers phase (clamped by the
            overall ``bringup_deadline_s`` budget).
        log_dir: parent dir for per-worker log files. **Required** —
            ``main.py`` passes ``f'{output_dir}/logs'`` so the logs are
            co-located with the rest of the run's artifacts and get
            wiped by ``--cleanup``. Final shape:
            ``<log_dir>/<job_group>/<host>.log``.
        bringup_deadline_s: hard cap on the entire bring-up.
        rl_algo: name of the RL algorithm. Only logged here — GPU mode and
            host-exclusivity are decided in the outer ``bsub``, since under
            single-allocation we cannot vary them per worker.

    Returns:
        Handle dict for ``stop_multinode_ray_cluster``.

    Raises:
        RayUpTimeoutError: bring-up did not complete within
            ``bringup_deadline_s`` (partial teardown already attempted).
        RuntimeError: if not running inside a multi-host LSF allocation,
            or if the host count doesn't match ``num_workers``, or if any
            worker process exits during bring-up.
