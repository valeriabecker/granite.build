- Standalone mode — all-in-one server with SQLite storage and thread-based execution
- Docker environment — run build steps in containers with GPU support
- Bash environment — run build steps as local processes (macOS/Linux)
- Kubernetes environment — run build steps as K8s jobs
- RunPod environment (beta) — run build steps on RunPod GPU instances
- SkyPilot/AWS environment (beta) — run build steps on cloud instances via SkyPilot
- HuggingFace Hub integration — download models and datasets via `hf://` URIs
- REST API — FastAPI-based build management at `/api/v1`
- Pipeline orchestration — multi-step builds defined in `build.yaml`
- Built-in steps: `gbstep`, `hfpull`, `hfpush`, `lhpull`, `lhpush`, `cosrclone`

### Changed

- **SkyPilot environment — secrets are now injected least-privilege (declared-only).**
  SkyPilot previously dumped the entire resolved space/user secret bag into the launched
  task environment. It now injects **only** the secrets a step declares under
  `config.skypilot.secrets.secret_names_to_use_as_env_variable`, matching the LSF and
  Kubernetes environments. **Migration:** a SkyPilot build that relied on an *undeclared*
  secret reaching the task env will now find that variable unset at runtime, with no
  launch-time error — add the secret to `secret_names_to_use_as_env_variable` to restore
  it. (Builds whose secret bag contained a non-identifier name were already failing to
  launch on SkyPilot before this change; see Fixed.)

### Fixed

- **SkyPilot launch crash on non-identifier secret names.** Whole-bag secret injection
  turned every secret name into a task env-var key, so a name such as `rits-access`
  violated SkyPilot's env-key naming rules and failed the launch. Declared secrets are
  mapped to valid env-var names via `secret_names_to_use_as_env_variable`, so hyphenated
  (and otherwise non-identifier) secret names no longer break SkyPilot launches.
