# Transform-mode entrypoint for the dpk step, invoked from the generated
# step.yaml's `run:` block and shipped to the node by `file_mounts: {src: src}`.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT INLINE YAML
# The step.yaml computes VALUES with Jinja (which module to run, where to read
# and write, the transform's argv) and this script does the SHELL. Keeping the
# shell here means it is a real file: shellcheck-able, `bash -n`-able, and
# testable directly rather than only through a rendered string. That matters
# because every bug this step has had was a shell/quoting bug invisible until a
# cluster run failed — a trailing "\" that swallowed the artifact marker, and
# single-quote escaping that broke a transform's ast.literal_eval'd value.
#
# It also collapses the escaping. Inline, a value passed Jinja -> YAML -> shell
# and needed an expression like `replace("'", "'\"'\"'")` to survive. Here the
# transform's flags arrive as real argv after a `--` separator, already split by
# the caller, so no shell re-quoting happens at all.
#
# CONTRACT
#   dpk_run.sh --module <mod> --input-path <dir> --output-path <dir> \
#              --artifact-id <id> [--validate <transform>] [--] [transform flags...]
#
#   --module       python module to run with `python -m` (a DPK
#                  PythonTransformLauncher accepting --data_local_config).
#   --input-path   directory the transform reads. The caller resolves this from
#                  the declared input's staged path ($GB_INPUT_<name>).
#   --output-path  directory the transform writes. May be RELATIVE (the step's
#                  default is ./output); it is created and absolutized here.
#   --artifact-id  the declared output's name, used in the artifact marker.
#   --validate     transform name to look for a validator for; omitted or empty
#                  means no validation. See VALIDATION below.
#   --             everything after it is passed through to the transform
#                  verbatim as argv. Optional, but required if any transform flag
#                  could otherwise look like one of the options above.
#
# VALIDATION
# With --validate <t>, the script runs ./src/validate_<t>.py after the transform
# succeeds, if that file exists. The lookup is a RULE, not a table: the step
# derives the path the same way it derives the python module, so adding a
# validator for another transform is dropping in a file — no change here or in
# step.yaml.
#
# A missing validator is NOT an error: `validate: true` is a general request, and
# most transforms have no validator yet. It is announced on stdout rather than
# skipped silently, because a silent skip reads as "validation passed" to anyone
# looking at a green build.
#
# The validator is run BEFORE the artifact marker is emitted, so a failure fails
# the target and the output is never registered. It writes validation.json into
# the output directory, so the validation record travels with the data it
# validated (safe: the validators glob for data suffixes, never *.json).
#
# The caller is responsible for activating the venv (bare-node mode) and for
# exporting $GB_INPUT_<name> for each declared input.

# The artifact marker is a SPACE-DELIMITED line consumed by a regex, and the path is
# then interpolated into a JSON string template by the skypilot monitor
# (builtins/monitors/skypilot/monitor.yaml). Two characters cannot be carried, and
# both fail SILENTLY:
#   * whitespace in the artifact id — the monitor captures binding_id with [^ ]+, so
#     "a b" registers as "a", binding the wrong artifact;
#   * a double quote in the path — it ends the monitor's JSON string early and
#     corrupts the event.
# Neither can be escaped here: the delimiter and the JSON template belong to the
# consumer, so the only honest response is to refuse and name the value.
#
# WHY UP HERE. These ran just before the marker, which meant a build with a space in
# its output name paid for the ENTIRE transform — minutes to hours on a real corpus —
# and the validator, and was only then rejected, registering nothing. Nothing about
# either value depends on the work, so both are checked before any is done. The
# output_path half still has to wait for the absolutize below, which is where its
