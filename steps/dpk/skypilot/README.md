# dpk (SkyPilot) — development

A general [Data Prep Kit](https://github.com/data-prep-kit/data-prep-kit) transform runner
for SkyPilot clusters. Runs on the **bare launcher node** by default (or in a public
container image), installing the transform's dependencies with `uv` during `setup` — no
custom image is built or published for this step.

It is the public-image counterpart of the custom-image
[eval](../../eval/skypilot/README.md) step, and is closely modelled on
[byoc](../../byoc/skypilot/README.md). It is *generated* from the sources in this directory
by the shared Makefile conventions — see the framework overview:
[steps/README.md](../../README.md).

## Design: byoc with three deltas

`byoc` already puts the build.yaml in control of the work. `dpk` keeps that shape and
changes three things:

| | byoc | dpk |
|---|---|---|
| **Dependencies** | `git clone` + `setup_command` | `transform` → `uv pip install` into `./venv` |
| **Invocation** | verbatim `command` only | `transform:` derives the module, flags, and data config; `module:` overrides the derived module |
| **Dependency set** | whatever the image/repo provides | derived from `transform` via DPK's per-transform pip extras |

The point of the derivation is that **one step serves every DPK transform**: adding
tokenization, PII redaction, or dedup is a build.yaml change, never a step change. Two rules
carry it, and both hold for any transform DPK ships (verified across all ~30):

- module — every transform exposes `dpk_<name>.runtime`, a `PythonTransformLauncher`
  accepting `--data_local_config`.
- pip extra — `data-prep-toolkit-transforms` declares one extra per transform, so
  `<name>` with `_`→`-` names it.

## Generating and deploying the step

`dpk` has no `Dockerfile`, so the `image`/`publish-image` targets are no-ops; only
`make space` (render the Space + bundle `src/`), `make test`, `make clean`, and `make help`
do anything here. For the full target list and variables, see the shared
[Makefile target conventions](../../README.md#makefile-target-conventions).

`make space` renders a self-contained Space into `space/` (see `SPACE_DIR` in the framework
overview). Point a build's Space at that directory to reference the step by
`space://steps/dpk`.

To promote the step into the repo's committed assets tree
(`configurations/assets/environments/skypilot/steps/dpk/`) and copy its per-cluster build
tests into `test/steps/dpk/skypilot/` so they are runnable from VSCode against the published
step, run `make publish-step`. Publishing also copies [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) to `README.md`
beside the published `step.yaml`, so the released step ships user-facing docs. See
[Two test modes](../../README.md#two-test-modes) for how the same test runs both against the
locally rendered `space/` (Mode 1, `make test`) and against the published step (Mode 2,
under `test/steps/`).

### Where the step's shell lives: `src/*.sh`

The `setup` and `run` blocks in `step-template.yaml` do **not** contain the step's shell.
They compute *values* with Jinja and hand them to two bundled scripts as arguments:

| Script | Invoked from | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `src/dpk_setup.sh` | `setup` (bare-node only) | bootstraps `uv`, anchors `UV_CACHE_DIR`, creates the venv, installs the requirements |
| `src/dpk_run.sh` | `run` (always) | creates + absolutizes the output dir, builds `--data_local_config`, runs `python -m <module>`, runs the validator when `validate: true`, emits the artifact marker |

The reason is testability. Shell embedded in a YAML scalar behind Jinja can only be
*rendered and pattern matched*; in a file it can be executed, `shellcheck`ed, and
`bash -n`'d. That matters for this step specifically: every bug it has had was a
shell/quoting bug invisible until a cluster run failed — a trailing `\` that swallowed the
artifact marker, and single-quote escaping that broke a transform's `ast.literal_eval`'d
value. It also collapses the escaping: flags now arrive as **real argv** after a `--`
separator, so nothing re-quotes them (the old inline form needed
`replace("'", "'\"'\"'")` to survive Jinja → YAML → shell).

Calling a file-mounted script from `setup` is safe because SkyPilot syncs file mounts
first: `sky/execution.py`'s stage order is `PROVISION → SYNC_WORKDIR → SYNC_FILE_MOUNTS →
SETUP → PRE_EXEC → EXEC`, and `_execute` calls `sync_file_mounts()` before `setup()`
unconditionally.

### A note on `src/` and `__pycache__`

`src/` holds python as well as shell. `make test` imports
`src/validate_tokenization2arrow.py`, which leaves a `src/__pycache__/` behind, and both `space` and
`publish-step` copy `src/` verbatim — so the Makefile drops that cache first, keeping the
tree shipped to a cluster to just the source. (It would never be *committed*:
`__pycache__/` is in the repo-root `.gitignore`, which also covers the published copy.)

## Running the tests

`make test` runs the whole `test/` tree against the locally rendered `space/`:

```
make -C steps/dpk/skypilot test    # uses the repo-root .venv; runs `make space` first
```

Two kinds of test live here, following the framework's split:

**Cluster-agnostic unit tests** at the root of `test/` — these need no infrastructure and
run everywhere. They are Mode-1 only (not copied by `publish-step`), the same placement as
`eval/skypilot/test/test_eval.py`:

- `test_dpk_step_render.py` — pins what the *template* computes: that `transform:` derives
  the right module and pip extra for a range of transforms, that `args` become the right
  argv words in order (with `0`/`true`/`false` handled correctly), that `dpk_image` switches
  between bare-node and `docker:` mode, that no config combination can derive a Ray module
  or inject a Ray-only flag, and that the rendered shell parses under `bash -n`. Because the blocks now
  invoke the bundled scripts, most assertions run the rendered block with a stub script on
  `PATH` and check **the argv bash actually built** (`_script_argv`) rather than matching
  rendered text — bash is what splits and unquotes these words on the node, so a quoting
  slip surfaces here exactly as it would in production.
- `test_dpk_run_sh.py` — executes `src/dpk_run.sh` with a stub `python`: the
  `--data_local_config` literal, the output dir being created and absolutized before the
  marker, flags (including quote-bearing python literals) reaching `python` untouched, the
  `--` separator shielding a transform flag that collides with one of the script's own
  options, failure propagation under `set -e`, and the marker being exactly one
  line-initial command.
- `test_dpk_setup_sh.py` — executes `src/dpk_setup.sh` with stub `pip`/`uv` that record
  their argv: that `uv` (not `pip`) installs and `pip` only bootstraps `uv`, that
  `UV_CACHE_DIR` is exported before `uv venv` and anchors at `$GB_SHARED_WORKDIR` when
  present, that the install keeps its cache, that a `[extra]` specifier arrives as one
  argument, and that zero requirements still yields a venv.
- `test_dpk_validate_tokenization2arrow.py` — unit tests for the bundled `src/validate_tokenization2arrow.py`,
  covering both of its axes: consistency (the Arrow token stream vs its `meta/` sidecars)
  and completeness (`--input`: every non-empty source Parquet produced output). Each
  corruption case asserts a *failure*, since a validator that only ever passes is worthless.

**Per-cluster build tests** under `test/<cluster>/` with fixtures in
`test-data/<cluster>/` — real-infra, extended-suite only, each self-skipping unless its
backend is reachable:

- **slurm** — needs the local Docker SLURM cluster (+ MinIO). Bring them up once with
  `make test-setup` (delegates to the repo-root `slurm-setup` / `minio-setup`). One target:
  `transform: tokenization2arrow` with `validate: true`, and `output_path` left at its
  `./output` default. So it covers three things a render test cannot — the derivations
  against real DPK, the validator hook running on a compute node before the artifact
  marker, and the relative default resolving inside SkyPilot's working directory into a path
  the monitor accepts.
- **slurm-pii** — the same step with `transform: pii_redactor`, proving generality: only
  `transform`/`args`/artifact names differ from the tokenization fixture. Slow (the
  `[pii-redactor]` extra is ~125 packages), hence `timeout_minutes: 60`. It is also the only
  cluster coverage of the `args` quoting path, since `pii_redactor_entities` is
  `ast.literal_eval`'d and must survive with its inner quotes intact.
- **aws** — provisions a real EC2 instance via SkyPilot; **self-skips unless** AWS
  credentials are present in the environment (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
  or `AWS_PROFILE`). Those env vars are the **skip-gate** — they decide whether the test
  runs, **not** how the build authenticates to AWS (that is `GB_AWS_*` → the `gb-skypilot`
  profile; see below). Two fixtures, the aws counterparts of the slurm ones:
  - **aws-tok** — `transform: tokenization2arrow` with `validate: true`, parallel
    (`runtime_num_processors: 2`). Proves the derivations and the in-step validator
    hook on real EC2.
  - **aws-pii** — `transform: pii_redactor`, the generality proof on aws (only
    `transform`/`args`/artifact names differ). Sequential and slow (the
    `[pii-redactor]` extra is ~125 packages), hence `timeout_minutes: 75`.

  Both gate on `aws_credentials_present()` + `@extended_testing_only`, so EC2 is never
  provisioned without credentials explicitly exported. On aws the hf pull is inline
  (injected into the step's setup), so `step_count` is 1, not 2.

  **How the build actually authenticates** (distinct from the skip-gate above): the aws
  `environment.yaml` resolves the secret names `GB_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
  `GB_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` through the space **secret manager** and materializes them into a
  non-default `gb-skypilot` profile that SkyPilot then selects (an explicit profile disables
  the ambient `AWS_*` provider). Standalone: seed those secret names (base64) into
  `~/.granite.build/space_secrets/` — or, since the secrets are lenient when absent, rely on an
  existing `[gb-skypilot]` profile already in `~/.aws/credentials`; shared: the server-managed
  store supplies them. (A bare `[default]` profile does **not** satisfy the skip-gate unless
  `AWS_PROFILE` or the key pair is exported.) **First-time setup walkthrough** (and the full
  runbook, identical to the byoc/eval steps):
  [docs/environments/skypilot-aws.md](../../../docs/environments/skypilot-aws.md#quickstart-run-the-aws-step-tests-for-the-first-time).

> **No cluster coverage of the cross-node `env:///shared` handoff.** It was covered by the
> two-target form of the `slurm` fixture, which `validate: true` replaced (see that fixture's
> build.yaml). Nothing exercises a two-target `env://` handoff end to end now; restore the

> bare node.

## Inputs, outputs, and bundled scripts

Moved here from USAGE.md: a build author needs the short rules (which USAGE.md keeps), but
the full mechanics below — which URI schemes stage where, why `output_path` cannot be
derived, and what the bundled scripts do — are implementation detail.

### Inputs and outputs

#### Inputs

Declare each input on the **target** (a direct `uri:`, or a `binding:` to an upstream
target's output), then resolve one of them into `input_path` in the build:

```yaml
dpk_config:
  input_path: "{{ bindings.docs.binding.path }}"
```

The step takes a **path**, not a binding name — the
[byoc](../../byoc/skypilot/USAGE.md) pattern, and byoc's `step-template.yaml` references
`bindings` zero times for the same reason. Filesystem-backed schemes (`hf://`, `env://`,
`file://`, `s3://`, `lh://`) are staged by the assetstore before `run`; an `hf://` input is
downloaded during `setup` automatically.

**Why a path and not a name.** The step used to take `input: <name>` and resolve it itself,
which meant exporting `$GB_INPUT_<name>` for every declared input and reading exactly one of
them back a few lines later. Nothing else ever read those variables — no bundled script, no
other step, and a build cannot, since this step runs one DPK module rather than arbitrary
code. They existed only to move a path from Jinja to a shell line below it, and that
indirection cost:

- a sanitizer, because `export GB_INPUT_raw-docs=` is a bash syntax error (and hyphenated
  binding names are in use in-tree — `samples/templates/local_multi_stage/build.yaml`
  declares `tuning-data` and `wait-for-eval`);
- a collision guard, because sanitizing is many-to-one and `raw-docs` / `raw.docs` mapped to
  the same variable, the second export silently winning;
- two guards validating the name against the declared bindings;
- a `set -u` abort of the whole run block when a name was mistyped, naming bash rather than
  the mistake.

All of it is gone. A step that never learns binding names cannot be wrong about them.

**What the path form costs instead**, and it is one thing: a misspelled binding name does not
fail at render. Step config renders with `strict=False` and `PreserveUndefined`
(`utils/template.py`), so `{{ bindings.dcos.binding.path }}` arrives as that literal text
rather than raising. `src/dpk_guard.sh` refuses an `input_path` still containing `{{` or `{%`,
before the install — but it cannot list the valid names, because it no longer knows them.

#### Outputs

Declare each output on the target, then make sure the bytes land at the path in its `uri`:

The step creates the directory, points the transform's `output_folder` at it, and emits the
artifact marker (`GB_ARTIFACT_ID:<id> GB_ARTIFACT_PATH:<abs-path>`) for you. `output_path`
defaults to `./output` in the step's working directory; set it explicitly when the output's
`uri` names a path, or when a **downstream target** reads the output — see
[When the default is not enough](#when-the-default-is-not-enough).

  `<output-id>` must match a declared `outputs.<id>`. Repeat the line to register several
  artifacts under one output. For `mem://` outputs use `GB_ARTIFACT_PATH` →
  `GB_ARTIFACT_STATE:<value>`.

##### When the default is not enough

`output_path: ""` (the default) writes to `./output` in the step's working directory, and the
step absolutizes it before emitting the marker. That is right for two common cases:

- a **terminal** output nothing downstream consumes;
- an output an **assetstore pushes** (e.g. `s3://…`), where the local dir is only a staging
  area.

Set it explicitly in either of these cases:

1. **The output's `uri` names a path.** The step cannot derive it — declared output URIs are
   not in the runtime render context — so keeping `uri` and `output_path` in agreement is
   the build author's job. A mismatch fails at run time, not at submit time.
2. **A downstream target reads the output.** The working directory is the *per-run* workdir
   (`${shared_workdir}/builds/<build_id>/runs/<targetrun_id>`), which is keyed **per target**
   and removed when that target finishes. A consumer in another target would read a deleted
   directory, so give the output an explicit shared path instead — see
   [Choosing the output URI per endpoint](#choosing-the-output-uri-per-endpoint).

> **Why does `input_path` come from the build but `output_path` cannot?** Because inputs and
> outputs reach the step differently. An input is **staged before `run`**, so its resolved
> path is already in the runtime context as `bindings.<name>.binding.path` and the build can
> hand it over. A declared **output does not exist yet** at render time: the runtime context
> is `bindings` + `run_metadata` + `setup_config` only, and declared output URIs reach
> *static validation* alone — so a build cannot resolve one the same way, and the step
> cannot derive it. Plumbing them into the runtime context would let the step derive
> `output_path` and drop the field — a gbserver change, tracked separately.

#### Choosing the output URI per endpoint

`validate`-style downstream targets read what an upstream target wrote, and the two may run
on **different nodes**. What works depends on the endpoint:

| Endpoint | Output URI | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `skypilot/slurm`, `skypilot/lsf` | `env:///shared/…` + an **explicit** matching `output_path` | `/shared` is the environment's `shared_workdir`, mounted on every node — cross-node safe. The `./output` default will not do here: it lives in the per-target workdir, which is deleted at target teardown. |
| `skypilot/aws`, `skypilot/kubernetes` | `s3://bucket/…`, `output_path` may be **left default** | Each target gets its own instance with no shared filesystem. The S3 assetstore pushes the staged dir and the consumer pulls it, so a node-local `./output` is fine. |

A node-local `env:///tmp/…` is **not** safe for a cross-target handoff: if the two targets
land on different nodes the consumer reads an absent directory.

### Bundled scripts (`src/`)

The step ships `src/` to `./src` on the node. Two of the three scripts are the step's own
machinery — you do not invoke them, but they are where the step's shell actually lives:

- `src/dpk_setup.sh` — the bare-node dependency install (`uv venv` + `uv pip install`),
  invoked from the step's `setup` phase. Skipped entirely when `dpk_image` is set.
- `src/dpk_run.sh` — the transform invocation: creates and absolutizes the output directory,
  builds DPK's `--data_local_config`, runs `python -m <module>`, optionally runs the
  validator, and emits the artifact marker.

The step.yaml computes the *values* (module, requirements, flags) and passes them to these
as arguments; the scripts do the shell. That keeps the shell in real files — checkable with
`shellcheck` and testable directly — rather than embedded in YAML behind Jinja.

The remaining script is the validator. It is not user-invoked either — `dpk_run.sh` runs it
automatically when `validate: true`, after the transform and before the artifact marker (see
"Validating output" in USAGE.md). The command line below is for running it by hand against an
output directory you already have, which is how to develop or debug one:

- [`src/validate_tokenization2arrow.py`](src/validate_tokenization2arrow.py) — validates `tokenization2arrow`
  output. Checks that the Arrow token stream agrees with its `meta/*.docs` /
  `meta/*.docs.ids` sidecars (a truncated or duplicated write is caught, where an
  exists-and-non-empty check would pass), and with `--input <parquet_dir>` also checks
  **completeness**: that every non-empty source Parquet actually produced output. Exits
  non-zero with a per-file report, failing the build.

  ```
  python src/validate_tokenization2arrow.py <tokenize_output_dir> <report_dir> [--input <source_parquet_dir>]
  ```

  It is read-only — it never deletes or rewrites anything.
#### Adding a validator for another transform

`validate: true` resolves the validator by **rule**: `src/validate_<transform>.py`, the same
derive-don't-tabulate shape as the module and pip-extra derivations. So adding coverage for a
second transform is:

1. Write `src/validate_<transform>.py` taking `<output_dir> <report_dir> [--input <src_dir>]`
   and exiting non-zero on a problem (mirror `validate_tokenization2arrow.py`).
2. Add `test_dpk_validate_<transform>.py` beside it. Make each corruption case assert a
   *failure* — a validator that only ever passes is worthless.

No change to `step-template.yaml`, `dpk_run.sh`, or this README's tables: builds that already
say `validate: true` for that transform start validating on the next publish. Until such a
file exists, `validate: true` for that transform is a loud no-op (see USAGE.md).

Keep the report interface identical — `<report_dir>` receives `validation.json` — because
`dpk_run.sh` passes the output dir for both arguments so the record ships inside the
registered artifact.

## Known gaps

- **There is no Ray mode, deliberately.** DPK ships a Ray runtime alongside the pure-python
  one and this step does not expose it. Recorded so it is not relitigated from scratch:
  DPK's Ray launcher cannot reach a cluster it did not start on localhost — in 1.1.8,
  `RayTransformLauncher._submit_for_execution` calls `ray.init("ray://localhost:10001")`, a
  hardcoded literal with no host or port argument anywhere in `data_processing_ray`, so
  `run_locally: false` attaches to port 10001 on the node the job is already running on
  rather than to a remote cluster; provisioning a cluster per step is SkyPilot's concern, and
  a step that stood one up would own its lifecycle, sizing and teardown; and the pure-python
  runtime already parallelises via `--runtime_num_processors`, which is what the SLURM
  environments this step targets actually need. `TestPurePythonIsTheOnlyRuntime` guards the
  removal — no config combination may derive a `.ray.runtime` module, install the `ray`
  extra, or inject `--run_locally` — because the mode previously caused trouble by being
  *half* applied: an extra without the module, or a module without its flag.
- **The pool size is left to the build, and auto-sizing was tried and reverted.**
  `runtime_num_processors` stays at DPK's own default of `0` (sequential); a build turns the
  pool on through `args`. Auto-sizing it on the node from
  `${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-${SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE:-$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)}}` was
  implemented, tested and backed out, because it is only correct on one of the four
  endpoints this step serves: the allocation-aware signals are SLURM's, and off SLURM the
  fallback is the machine's core count, which inside a cgroup-limited container reports the
  **host** — measured, a `--cpus=1` container reports `6`. On Kubernetes that forks 6 workers
  into a 1-CPU cgroup: throttling, context-switching, and 6x the memory for no throughput. A
  default that helps on SLURM and harms on Kubernetes is worse than no default. Peak memory
  is the second reason: each worker holds its own copy of the transform's models (a
  `pii_redactor` worker loads flair and presidio), so pool size is really a memory decision
  and only the build knows the node's RAM. Two traps if this is revisited: `os.cpu_count()`
  cannot be a Jinja default (the template renders on the **server**, the pool runs on the
  **node**), and `-1` is not an "all cores" sentinel — DPK gates on `num_processors > 0`, so
  `-1` silently means sequential and `multiprocessing.Pool` rejects anything below 1.
- **Flag prefixes are not derived.** DPK's own prefix is an arbitrary abbreviation for
  roughly 40% of transforms (`dpk_tokenization` → `tkn_`, `gopher_repetition_annotator` →
  `gra_`, `doc_quality` → `docq_`), so `args` keys are the full flag name and the step passes
  them through verbatim. Deriving them would need a per-transform table in the step — exactly
  what stops it being general.
- **`output_path` is unchecked against the output's `uri`.** `output_path` is optional and
  defaults to `./output` in the step's working directory, but when the declared output `uri`
  names a path the build still supplies both and nothing validates that they agree; a
  mismatch fails at run time. The step cannot derive the path because declared output URIs
  are not in the runtime render context — `step_outputs` exists
  (`src/gbserver/build/targetstep.py`, `_get_validation_context`) but is built for static
  validation only, while the runtime render passes `bindings` / `run_metadata` /
  `setup_config` (`build/targetsteprun.py`). Plumbing declared outputs into the runtime
  context would let the step derive `output_path` and auto-emit the artifact marker for every
  declared output, removing the field entirely; that is a gbserver change, tracked
  separately.
- **The default `output_path` cannot serve a cross-target handoff.** `./output` resolves
  inside the per-run workdir (`${shared_workdir}/builds/<build_id>/runs/<targetrun_id>`),
  which is minted per **target** by `setup_skypilot` and `rm -rf`'d by `teardown_skypilot`
  when that target completes. A downstream target binding such an output would read a deleted
  directory, so an output another target consumes needs an explicit shared path. No fixture
  demonstrates that any more (the two-target `slurm` form that did was replaced by
  `validate: true`); USAGE.md's "When a downstream target reads the output" is the worked
  example. Nothing detects the mistake at submit time; it surfaces as a missing input on the
  consumer.
- **A step default cannot be asserted via `expected_steps`.** `expected_steps` compares
  against the **persisted** step config, which records only the keys the `build.yaml`
  supplied — `step-template.yaml`'s own defaults are not merged into it. So an omitted
  `dpk_config.output_path` is *absent* from the stored config rather than present as `""`,
  and `_assert_contains_subset` requires every expected key to exist (it fails with
  `missing key 'output_path'`). So assert a default's *effect* — the `slurm` fixture's
  `output_artifact_count: 1` could not hold unless the defaulted `output_path` resolved —
  rather than the field's value.
- **Heavy transforms pay a per-cluster install.** `pii_redactor` pulls presidio + flair
  (hundreds of MB of models). `dpk_image` is the escape hatch, but note DPK publishes only
  `.devN` snapshot images — there is no `1.1.8` image on quay.io; the newest
  `tokenization-ray` tag carrying `dpk_tokenization2arrow` is `1.1.7.dev0`.
