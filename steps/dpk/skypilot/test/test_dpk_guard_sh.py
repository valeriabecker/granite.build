"""Behaviour tests for the bundled ``src/dpk_guard.sh``.

These guards used to be ~130 lines of Jinja duplicated across the ``setup`` and ``run``
blocks, which meant they could only be *rendered and pattern matched*, and needed their
own test just to police the two copies for drift. Moving them into a script makes them
executable, ``shellcheck``-able and testable directly — which is the same reason the
rest of this step's shell lives in ``src/*.sh``.

Each test runs the real script. What matters about a guard is the pair (does it refuse
the configs it should, does it stay silent on the ones it should), so both directions
are asserted throughout: a guard that refuses everything is as useless as one that
refuses nothing.

Cluster-agnostic, so this sits at the root of the step's ``test/`` dir (Mode 1 only) and
is not copied by ``make publish-step``.
