## What is Granite.Build?

Granite.Build orchestrates LLM build pipelines. You describe your workflow in a `build.yaml` file — which models to download, how to fine-tune them, what evaluations to run — and Granite.Build executes each step in the environment you choose: a local Docker container, a Kubernetes cluster, a cloud GPU instance, or a plain bash process on your laptop.

The system has three main components:

- **gbserver** — the orchestration server. It provides a REST API (`/api/v1`) for build management and a build watcher that polls for pending builds and dispatches them to execution environments. It stores build metadata in SQLite (standalone) or PostgreSQL (production).

- **gb** (gbcli) — the command-line client. It talks to the server's REST API to submit builds, list status, manage artifacts, and more.

- **build.yaml** — the pipeline definition. Each file declares a set of named **targets** (logical stages like "download", "fine-tune", "evaluate"). Each target specifies an execution environment, input/output artifacts, and one or more **steps** to run. Targets can depend on each other through artifact **bindings** — when an upstream target produces an output, downstream targets that reference it are automatically dispatched.

```

The **BuildWatcher** polls storage for pending builds and creates a **BuildRunner** for each one.
The build runs in an associated **Space** providing environments, credentials, artifact stores and step implementations.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/build-execution.jpg" alt="Build Execution" width="50%" />
</p>

The buildrunner walks the target graph, resolving dependencies and launching steps through the configured **Environment** (Docker, Kubernetes, Bash, RunPod, or SkyPilot). Each step can pull inputs from and push outputs to **artifact stores** selected by URI scheme (`hf://`, `file://`, `git://`, `cos://`).

Granite.build can be configured to run in the cloud
or on the local machine.
A cloud-based configuration can be seen [here](docs/images/architecture-cloud.jpg).
Most of what follows utilizes the standalone configuration, shown below.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/architecture-standalone.jpg" alt="Granite.Build Standalone Configuration" />
</p>

## Quick start (standalone)

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+ and yarn (for the web dashboard).

In a new terminal, run the following:
```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite.build.git
cd granite.build

# 2. Create the venv and install (no Artifactory or cloud creds needed)
make standalone-venv PYTHON=python3.13
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Compile the web dashboard (run once, or after any frontend/ change)
make build-frontend

# 4. Start the standalone server, pointed at the in-repo local space
gbserver standalone --space-dir configurations/spaces/local
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser to access the dashboard.

In a second terminal, submit a build:

```bash
# 5. Activate the venv and submit the sample build
cd granite.build
source .venv/bin/activate
export GB_ENVIRONMENT=STANDALONE
gb build start -f samples/standalone/standalone-quickstart/build.yaml

# 6. Watch progress
gb build status <build-id>
gb build log <build-id>
```

The sample runs a single step in a local bash process — no Docker required. To switch backends, edit the `environment_uri` line in
[`samples/standalone/standalone-quickstart/build.yaml`](samples/standalone/standalone-quickstart/build.yaml); the file has `bash`, `docker`, `runpod`, and `skypilot` options pre-commented.

> **Auth note (skip for localhost):** when the client and server are both on the same host, `gbserver` allows unauthenticated access from `127.0.0.1` / `::1` and the quickstart above just works. If you're running `gbserver` on a remote box (or hitting auth errors), set a shared secret in both terminals before running steps 3 and 4:
>
> ```bash
> export GBSERVER_API_KEY="my-secret-key"   # same value in both terminals
> ```

For a longer walkthrough of the same path, see [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

## Example `build.yaml`

A minimal pipeline that runs a single step in a Docker container:

```yaml
llm.build:                   # alias: granite.build (both keys are accepted)
  name: my-build
  targets:
    download:
      environment_uri: space://environments/docker
      inputs:
        model:
          uri: hf://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct
      outputs:
        model:
          uri: file:workspace/model
      steps:
        - step_uri: space://steps/somestep
```

A multi-target pipeline chains stages through bindings:

```yaml
llm.build:
  name: tune-and-eval
  targets:
    download:
      environment_uri: space://environments/docker
      outputs:
        model: { uri: file:workspace/model }
      steps:
        - step_uri: space://steps/somestep
    fine-tune:
      environment_uri: space://environments/docker
      inputs:
        model: { binding: download.model }
      outputs:
        checkpoint: { uri: file:workspace/checkpoint }
      steps:
        - step_uri: space://steps/sft
    evaluate:
      environment_uri: space://environments/docker
      inputs:
        model: { binding: fine-tune.checkpoint }
      steps:
        - step_uri: space://steps/eval
```

## CLI

The CLI client is available as multiple equivalent entry points: `gb`, `gbcli`, `llmbuild`, `llmb`, `lamb`. The test harness ships as `gbtest`, and the server ships as `gbserver`.

```
gb               # client (build, artifact, space, secret, model, ...)
gbserver         # server (standalone, rest-server, build-watch, build, ...)
gbtest           # YAML-driven build assertions for tests
```

Run `gb --help` or `gbserver --help` for top-level usage. Common flows:

```bash
gb build start -f build.yaml      # submit a build
gb build list                     # list recent builds
gb build status <build-id>        # show build state and per-step status
gb build log <build-id>           # stream logs
gb build cancel <build-id>        # cancel a running build
gb artifact list                  # list artifacts
```

For the full subcommand reference, see [`docs/cli/gb-cli-reference.md`](docs/cli/gb-cli-reference.md).

## REST API

The REST API is available at `/api/v1` when the server is running. Start with `gbserver standalone` or `gbserver rest-server`, then browse the interactive OpenAPI docs — each API group is a mounted sub-app with its own page, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/builds/docs`. See [`docs/rest-api/`](docs/rest-api/README.md) for the API map and authentication options (GitHub, IBMid, API key).

## Web Dashboard

The gb-ui dashboard is a React/TypeScript app (Carbon Design System) that ships with gbserver. In standalone mode it is served by gbserver at port 8080 — no separate Node.js process needed at runtime.

**Build prerequisite:** Node.js 20+ and yarn are required to compile the frontend. They are only needed at build time; the output is plain static files.

### Mode 1 — Standalone (default, recommended)

gbserver compiles and serves the UI and REST API from the same origin. This is the normal mode for end users.

**First-time setup:**

```bash
make build-frontend     # compile and copy to src/gbserver/static/ui/
gbserver standalone     # UI + API + analytics at http://localhost:8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` — the dashboard, REST API, and analytics routes are all served on port 8080.

**After any frontend code change:**

```bash
make build-frontend                        # incremental rebuild (reuses .next/ cache)
make clean-frontend && make build-frontend # full clean rebuild (clears cache first)
```

### Mode 2 — Dev server (hot reload)

Runs the Next.js dev server with instant hot reload. Use this when iterating on frontend code without rebuilding the static export after each change.

**Without a backend** — the UI loads but data pages show empty states:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install   # first time only
yarn dev       # UI at https://localhost:3000
```

**With a running gbserver** — copy the dev template and set the API URL:

```bash
cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
# then edit frontend/.env.local and uncomment:
# GBSERVER_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

```bash
gbserver standalone   # terminal 1 — start gbserver
cd frontend && yarn dev   # terminal 2 — start dev server
```

The dev server proxies all `/api/*` requests to gbserver server-side — no CORS configuration needed.

### Mode 3 — Remote gbserver

To build the frontend pointing at a gbserver on a different host, set `GBSERVER_API_URL` at build time (it gets baked into the bundle):

```bash
GBSERVER_API_URL=https://my-server:8080 make build-frontend
```

Leave it unset to default to same-origin (the standard case when gbserver serves the frontend).

### Analytics service

`gb_ui_backend` adds build status charts, failure trends, and optional AI-powered analysis. It is bundled with the `standalone` install extra; if installed, gbserver includes its routers directly into its own process at startup — no extra command or initial database setup needed.

Default storage: derived from the main store's own backend. Standalone SQLite mode uses its own `~/.granite.build/dashboard-analytics.db` (SQLite, auto-created on first run). Postgres mode (`GBSERVER_METADATA_STORAGE=sql`) connects to the same Postgres instance as the main store.

Optional configuration (set as environment variables or in `.env`):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GB_UI_DATABASE_URL` | Override the analytics DB — SQLite path or PostgreSQL URL |
| `GB_UI_GBSERVER_DB_URL` | gbserver's own DB for richer build volume charts (auto-set when storage is SQLite) |
| `GB_UI_LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint for AI failure analysis (feature disabled if unset) |
| `GB_UI_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for the LLM endpoint |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for a full annotated reference of all options:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`/api/analytics/*` is served by gbserver itself, in-process — the browser only ever talks to port 8080; there's no separate port or process.

### Frontend layout

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `frontend/` | Next.js source (TypeScript, React, Carbon Design System) |
| `frontend/out/` | Static export — produced by `make build-frontend`, not committed |
| `frontend/.env.local.example` | Dev template — copy to `frontend/.env.local` |
| `src/gbserver/static/ui/` | Runtime path gbserver serves the compiled frontend from |
| `src/gb_ui_backend/` | Analytics service — FastAPI routers for charts and AI analysis, included directly into gbserver |

## Coding agent skills

This repo ships **Agent Skills** under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) so a coding agent working in a granite.build checkout can operate the tool without you re-explaining it each time. Both **Claude Code** and **OpenCode** discover them natively when your working directory is inside the repo — Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/` directly, and OpenCode's [built-in skill discovery](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) also loads Claude-compatible `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. No install; invoke one explicitly with `/<name>`, or let the agent select it from your request based on the skill's description.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`run-gbserver`](.claude/skills/run-gbserver/SKILL.md) | Ensure the standalone `gbserver` backend is running (via the `gbserver_start` tool) — the prerequisite for running any build. |
| [`create-build`](.claude/skills/create-build/SKILL.md) | Author a `build.yaml` that runs a workload inline via the built-in `command` step — training, inference/serving, data generation, or evaluation. |
| [`create-step`](.claude/skills/create-step/SKILL.md) | Author a reusable custom step (`step.yaml` + `bash_scripts/`, referenced by a `file://` URI) — for owned or multi-file code. |
| [`gb-docs`](.claude/skills/gb-docs/SKILL.md) | Look up the in-repo [`docs/`](docs/) (schema, CLI, concepts, troubleshooting) and answer grounded in them. |

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` (`name` + `description` + instructions) in the portable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format; the agent matches on the `description` to decide when to use it.

## Coding agent tools (MCP)

Skills teach an agent *how* to work with granite.build; **`gbmcp`** lets it *act* — start/stop the backend, run, monitor, and cancel builds, and manage secrets, over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It's the [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server bundled at [`src/gbmcp/`](src/gbmcp/), and it runs as a **local stdio process the agent launches** — no port, no endpoint to register, and it connects at session start whether or not the backend is running.

Setup is zero-config in a checkout. The `standalone` install includes gbmcp, and this repo ships the per-agent config both editors discover automatically when your working directory is inside the repo — [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) for **Claude Code** and [`opencode.json`](opencode.json) for **OpenCode**. Just approve/enable it once:

```bash
make standalone-venv PYTHON=python3.13     # installs gbmcp + gbserver
# open Claude Code (or OpenCode) in the repo, approve/enable the "gbmcp"
# server, then ask it to "list my builds" or "run the quickstart build"
```

You don't start gbserver by hand: the agent calls `gbserver_start` (which launches `gbserver standalone` and waits until it's ready) the first time it needs the backend. No auth is needed — gbmcp talks to an unauthenticated localhost gbserver.

The server exposes 18 tools: **gbserver** (`gbserver_status`, `gbserver_start`, `gbserver_stop`), **Builds** (`build_start`, `build_list`, `build_status`, `build_describe`, `build_log`, `build_job_log`, `build_cancel`), **Secrets** (`secret_list/get/create/update/delete` — values never flow through the agent), and **Info** (health and versions).

> **Non-default port:** `export GBSERVER_PORT=<p>` before launching the editor and both the build tools and `gbserver_start` retarget to it. Under the hood, gbmcp treats `GBSERVER_PORT` as the single source of truth (deriving `GBSERVER_HOST` from it) and defaults to `8080`; Claude Code passes it through `.mcp.json`'s `${GBSERVER_PORT:-8080}` expansion, while OpenCode's spawned process inherits it directly (no `environment` block needed).

See [`src/gbmcp/README.md`](src/gbmcp/README.md) for the full toolset, backend management, and the stdio handshake test.

## Try the demos

End-to-end demos with TRL fine-tuning and unitxt evaluation. Each runs locally and tears down cleanly. Full setup instructions in [`docs/demos/`](docs/demos/).

```bash
# Standalone Docker — fine-tune + eval in containers on this machine
make demo-venv PYTHON=python3.13 && source .venv/bin/activate
bash scripts/demo-standalone.sh

# SLURM via SkyPilot — same workload on a local Docker SLURM cluster, with MinIO push
make g4os-skypilot-venv PYTHON=python3.13 && source .venv/bin/activate
make minio-setup && make slurm-setup
bash scripts/demo-slurm.sh
