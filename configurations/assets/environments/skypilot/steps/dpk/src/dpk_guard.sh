# Required-config guards for the dpk step, invoked from the TOP of both the generated
# step.yaml's `setup:` and `run:` blocks and shipped to the node by
# `file_mounts: {src: src}`.
#
# WHY THESE LIVE HERE RATHER THAN IN JINJA
# Review feedback, and it agreed with a principle this step already claimed: shell
# embedded in a YAML scalar behind Jinja can only be RENDERED and pattern matched,
# while shell in a file can be executed, shellcheck'd, `bash -n`'d and unit tested.
# These guards were ~130 lines of Jinja duplicated across both blocks (Jinja macros
# are block-scoped, so the text could not be shared), which needed its own test just
# to police the two copies for drift. Here they are one script called twice.
#
# WHY THEY RUN IN BOTH PHASES
# `setup` is the expensive one: the launcher prepends `hf download` for every hf://
# input binding into it, then dpk_setup.sh bootstraps uv, creates the venv and installs
# the transform's extra — 125 packages including torch/flair/presidio for pii_redactor.
# Guarding only in `run` meant an invalid build paid all of that before being refused.
# `run` guards too because it can be reached on a warm cluster without a fresh setup.
#
# WHY THE TEMPLATE CALLS THIS, AND NOT dpk_setup.sh / dpk_run.sh
# Asked in review, and the answer is that neither work script can do it. Two reasons:
#
#   1. There is no single script both phases pass through. `setup` and `run` are separate
#      SkyPilot lifecycle phases with separate entrypoints (dpk_setup.sh, dpk_run.sh), so
#      the guard needs two call sites either way; only the template sits above both.
#   2. Neither script is told what the transform rule needs. dpk_run.sh receives the
#      DERIVED module, not `transform`/`dpk_image` — and the derived value cannot
#      distinguish the valid config from the invalid one:
#
#        module: dpk_x.runtime, no image  ->  --module 'dpk_x.runtime'   INVALID (empty venv)
#        module: dpk_x.runtime + image    ->  --module 'dpk_x.runtime'   VALID
#
#      Same value, opposite verdicts; the difference is whether an install happened, which
#      dpk_run.sh is not told. It would catch the `dpk_.runtime` cases and miss exactly the
#      `module`-alone hole that a review round found. dpk_setup.sh is worse: it is not
#      invoked at all in image mode, so it can never see the image-set cases.
#
# Moving the call would therefore mean passing `transform`, `dpk_image` and `output` into
# dpk_run.sh — options it has no other use for — and all five into dpk_setup.sh. The Jinja
# does not shrink, it relocates, and guard ordering stops being visible at the call site,
# which is the bug this step already had once (marker guards after the transform, not
# before). Left in the template deliberately.
#
# WHAT IS NOT HERE
# Nothing, now. Every config guard this step has is in this file, which is the point:
# review asked why the `args` KEY check was still in the template, and the honest
# answer was that my reason for leaving it there was wrong. I had claimed keys arrive
# as already-rendered argv words, where a valid `--tkn_chunk_size` and a typo'd
# `--tkn-chunk-size` are indistinguishable. That is true of the rendered words but not
# a constraint: the template can pass the keys THEMSELVES, which it now does, one
# `--arg-key` per key. See "THE ARGS KEYS" below.
#
# There used to be another — an input-name COLLISION check, for two declared inputs
# whose names sanitized to the same $GB_INPUT_ variable. It is gone along with the
# names: the step takes `input_path` as a PATH resolved by the build (the byoc
# pattern), so it never learns binding names and cannot be wrong about them.
#
# CONTRACT
#   dpk_guard.sh --transform <t> --module <m> --dpk-image <i> \
#                --output <name> --input-path <dir> \
#                [--arg-key <key> ...] --arg-keys-empty <flag>
#
#   Every option is REQUIRED but may be EMPTY — that is what is being checked.
#
#   --arg-key is repeated once per key of dpk_config.args, carrying the RAW key before
#   it is rendered into a flag word. See "THE ARGS KEYS" below for why the keys are
#   passed as data, and one per option rather than as one separated list.
#
#   --arg-keys-empty is non-empty when at least one key was the empty string. It needs
#   its own option because an empty key renders no --arg-key word to be seen.

# Pattern matching below must be ASCII-exact: see the args-keys section for why a
# UTF-8 locale silently widens [A-Za-z0-9_] to accept accented letters. Exported so
# it holds for the whole script rather than one command.

# --- transform ------------------------------------------------------------------
# `transform` supplies TWO things — a module name AND a pip extra — so whatever exempts
# a build from setting it has to supply both. Neither override does alone, and this
# guard was wrong in both directions before landing on the conjunction:
#
#   `transform or module`    — `module` gives a module but no dependencies, so it built
#                              a venv with NO DPK and died "No module named dpk_custom".
#   `transform or dpk_image` — `dpk_image` removes the install but gives no module, so
#                              it rendered `--module 'dpk_.runtime'` and died
#                              "No module named dpk_".
#
# Both are verbatim the illegible failure this guard exists to prevent, reached THROUGH
# the guard. So: an image to skip the install AND a module to run.

# Only EMPTINESS is checkable, here or in Jinja: declared OUTPUTS are not in the
# runtime render context (targetstep.py's _get_validation_context vs the runtime
# bindings/run_metadata/setup_config), and the node never learns them either. Worth
# knowing what that leaves open, because it is worse than the empty case — a MISTYPED
# output emits GB_ARTIFACT_ID:<typo>, buildrun.py logs "failed to find output binding
# ... Ignoring" and continues, so the target goes GREEN having registered nothing and a
# downstream target then fails pointing elsewhere. Recorded in README.md's Known gaps.

# The step takes a PATH, resolved by the build from its own declared inputs (the byoc
# pattern), rather than the NAME of a binding it would have to resolve itself. So the
# name-shaped failures are gone: no sanitizing, no collision between two names that
# sanitize alike, and no `set -u` abort from a mistyped variable name.
#
# What replaces them is one failure the PATH form introduces, and it is quiet.

# after the install, complaining about a path nobody wrote.

# So refuse anything that still looks like a template. `{{` cannot appear in a real
# staged path — those are assetstore-built (hf cache dirs, shared workdirs) — so this

# --- args keys ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each key of dpk_config.args becomes a flag word `--<key>`, so a key that is not a
# legal flag name produces an argv word DPK's launcher cannot parse. It uses
# parse_args() rather than parse_known_args(), so it exits on the FIRST unknown flag
# with "unrecognized arguments" — after the install, naming argparse rather than the
# key. Three shapes reach that failure:
#
#   tkn-chunk-size: 4     -> `--tkn-chunk-size 4`   no such flag; DPK's are all
#                                                   underscored (checked: 221 flags
#                                                   across 45 modules, 0 hyphenated)
#   tkn chunk size: 4     -> `--tkn chunk size 4`   one key becomes three argv words
#   "": 4                 -> `-- 4`                 a bare `--`, which python takes
#                                                   as an argv separator, then chokes
#                                                   on the orphaned value
#
# THE ARGS KEYS, and why each arrives as its own option
#
# The keys are checked from repeated `--arg-key <key>` options rather than from the
# rendered `-- --flag val` words, for two reasons:
#
#   1. In the rendered form a flag name and a value are not distinguishable. A value
#      that itself begins with `--` is a legal thing for a build to pass, and reading
#      argv back would reject it.
#   2. One key per option means the shell never splits the list, so a key containing a
#      space stays ONE word and is caught. Passing them space-separated in a single
#      option looked simpler and was wrong: `tkn size` split into `tkn` and `size`,
#      both individually legal, and the bad key passed. The Jinja this replaced caught
#      it, so that would have been a regression.
#
# An empty key survives neither form — it renders no word at all — so it is signalled
# separately by --arg-keys-empty, computed where the keys are still a list.
# The LC_ALL=C set at the top of this script is load-bearing here, not hygiene. Bash's
# bracket expressions are locale-aware,
# so [!A-Za-z0-9_] does NOT match an accented letter under a UTF-8 locale: `tkn_sizé`
# was accepted under en_US.UTF-8 and rejected under C. The Jinja this replaced tested
# membership in a literal ASCII string, which has no such dependency, so without this
# the check would pass on a C-locale CI runner and let the key through on a UTF-8 node.
# argparse would then reject the flag, which is the failure this guard exists to pre-empt.
