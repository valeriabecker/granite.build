# tags are generally of the form vX.Y.z, for example v0.2.36
# Warning: there is not check for tag collision
#
# In addition to the immutable vX.Y.Z tag, this maintains two moving tags:
#   stable         - always advanced to the latest release; what the documented
#                    upgrade command pins (git+https://...granite.build.git@stable).
#   min-supported  - the floor below which the CLI hard-blocks. NOT advanced
#                    automatically (moving it drops support for older clients);
#                    advance it only with the --move-min-supported flag.
#
# Usage: scripts/tag-main.sh vX.Y.Z [--move-min-supported]

# already exists — re-point the moving tags by hand if you need to after that.)

# `min-supported` marks the floor below which the CLI refuses to run. Advance it only
# when explicitly requested, since moving it drops support for older clients. `git tag -f`
# here creates it lightweight, but that doesn't matter to the CLI: it resolves the floor
# via each tag's peeled commit SHA (the /repos/.../tags endpoint), so a `min-supported`
# created either lightweight or annotated (`git tag -a`) resolves to the vX.Y.Z it shares
# a commit with.
