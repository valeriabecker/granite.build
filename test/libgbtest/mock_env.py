"""Mock environment variable defaults for running tests without external dependencies.

Applied by conftest.py:pytest_sessionstart when GBTEST_MODE=mock.

MOCK_ENV_FORCED: Always set in mock mode (override any existing env vars).
    These are the variables that control whether external calls happen — they
    must be forced to prevent a developer's shell env from defeating mock mode.

MOCK_ENV_DEFAULTS: Only set if not already present (setdefault semantics).
    These provide safe placeholders for variables read at import time.
