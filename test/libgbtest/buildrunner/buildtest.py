    """YAML-driven variant of AbstractBuildRunnerTest.

    Concrete subclasses override exactly one method, ``_get_yaml_spec_dir``,
    which returns the directory containing this fixture's ``build.yaml`` and
    ``buildtest.yaml``.  This base class implements ``_get_test_specification``
    (loads the YAML) and provides ``test_runner`` + ``test_runner_cancellation``
    methods that consult the spec's ``tests:`` list and skip themselves when
    the YAML doesn't opt in.

    Example:
        @extended_testing_only
        @pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="buildtest_cpu")
        class TestBuildRunner1StepCPU(AbstractYamlBuildRunnerTest):
