"""Pytest test class invoked by the ``gbtest`` CLI.

This module is loaded only when pytest collects it via the explicit path
passed by ``gbtest.py``'s ``main()``.  Keeping the heavy
``AbstractYamlBuildRunnerTest`` import (and its transitive load of
``lib.test_utils``) here — rather than in the CLI entry module — ensures
those imports happen AFTER ``pytest_sessionstart`` runs, so
``GBSERVER_GITHUB_TOKEN`` is captured fresh from the loaded secrets.

Pytest collects test classes from any file given by explicit path regardless
of the ``python_files`` pattern, so the unconventional filename is fine.
``test/libgbtest/`` is not in ``testpaths`` (see pyproject.toml), so a plain
``pytest`` run won't pick this class up as a side effect.
