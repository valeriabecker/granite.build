"""
Unit tests for log stream draining behavior after stop_event is set.

These tests verify the two-phase draining solution that fixes the issue where
log monitoring exits prematurely, causing loss of critical log lines and events
(like ARTIFACT_PUSHED_EVENT).

Background:
-----------
When LSF jobs complete, the bsub monitor detects completion and sets stop_event
after a grace period. However, the logfile monitor may still have buffered log
lines that were written but not yet read. Without proper draining, these final
lines (like "Pushed URI", "lhpush end", ARTIFACT_PUSHED events) are lost.

Solution:
---------
Two-phase draining approach:
- Phase 1: Real-time streaming (tail -F for SSH, readline loop for local files)
- Phase 2: Final complete read after stop_event is set
  - SSH: Terminate tail -F, execute tail -n +N to read remaining lines
  - Local: Continue reading until true EOF

Test Coverage:
--------------
1. test_local_file_stream_drains_remaining_lines
   - Verifies LocalFileStream Phase 2 draining captures lines written during monitoring

2. test_ssh_file_stream_drains_with_tail_command
   - Verifies SSHFileStream executes `tail -n +N` command with correct line offset
   - Confirms Phase 1 (tail -F) → Phase 2 (tail -n +4) transition

3. test_logfile_monitor_processes_all_drained_lines
   - Verifies LogFileMonitor processes ALL lines including those from Phase 2
   - Tests critical event lines like `GB_EVENT_WORKLOAD_STATUS:success` (the
     standardized prefix; the legacy `LLMB_` prefix is still accepted by the
     monitor regexes, exercised in test_step_metadata_marker.py)

4. test_lsf_bsub_and_logfile_monitor_coordination (INTEGRATION TEST - Most Important)
   - Simulates realistic LSF job execution with bsub monitor and logfile monitor
   - Verifies the critical "Pushed URI" line is captured via Phase 2 draining
   - Demonstrates the fix for the original issue where ARTIFACT_PUSHED_EVENT was lost

5. test_ssh_file_stream_phase2_executes_tail_command
   - Verifies line counting during Phase 1 and correct tail command in Phase 2
   - Confirms `tail -n +4` is used to skip already-read lines

6. test_logfile_monitor_does_not_exit_early_on_stop_event
   - Verifies the fix where we removed the early exit check
   - Ensures monitor continues consuming all streamed lines

7. test_local_file_stream_no_remaining_lines_to_drain
   - Tests edge case where Phase 2 finds no remaining lines
   - Verifies graceful handling when monitoring keeps up with writes
