"""State-machine tests for LSFBsubMonitor.

These drive a real ``LSFBsubMonitor`` against a scripted sequence of ``bjobs``
JSON responses (the same harness idiom as
``test/unit/monitoring/test_log_draining.py``), which lets us replay LSF states
that are awkward or impossible to produce on demand against a real cluster.

Every test goes through :func:`_drive`, which bounds the monitor with
``asyncio.wait_for``. That is deliberate: the monitor's poll loop wraps its whole
body in ``except Exception: continue``, so a classification bug becomes an
*infinite loop* rather than an error. The bounded wait converts that into a
deterministic failure -- and for the non-terminal states, "it keeps polling" is
itself the assertion.
