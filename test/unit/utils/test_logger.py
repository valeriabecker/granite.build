"""Regression tests for gbserver.utils.logger stream binding.

Issue #315: a bare ``logging.StreamHandler()`` captures ``sys.stderr`` at
construction and holds it forever. The ``gbserver`` root group reconfigures
logging inside ``click.testing.CliRunner.invoke()``, where ``sys.stderr`` is an
in-memory buffer that CliRunner later closes / garbage-collects. A captured
reference lets a cross-boundary log write (or CliRunner's own ``getvalue()``)
land on a closed file, producing flaky ``ValueError: I/O operation on closed
file`` failures under large parallel test runs. The console handler must resolve
the *current* ``sys.stderr`` at emit time rather than pin a transient stream.
