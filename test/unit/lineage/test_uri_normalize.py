"""Tests for URI normalization, the lineage index's node identity.

Two properties matter, and they are not symmetric. Spellings of one artifact must
converge, or the graph splits into disconnected pieces -- visible and fixable.
Spellings of *different* artifacts must never converge, because that invents
provenance: someone reads that a model was trained on data it never saw. The
negative tests here are therefore as load-bearing as the positive ones.
