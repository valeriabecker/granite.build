"""Unit tests for the admin-DB lineage reconciliation (the central mechanism).

These tests use an in-memory stub admin storage and a stub lineage store, so
they run in CI without a cluster, PostgreSQL, or wandb credentials. They verify
that reconciliation selects successful targets from the admin DB by a
``finished_at`` time watermark and records each through the single leaf, that a
full catch-up (no watermark) recovers targets that appeared while the recorder
was down (no restart blind spot), that steady-state scans read only newly-
finished targets, and that the per-sink ``filter_unrecorded`` check decides what
each sink actually records.
