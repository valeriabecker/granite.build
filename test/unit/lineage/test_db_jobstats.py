"""Tests for the sink that writes lineage into the local index.

Run against a real SQLite row storage, not a fake: the properties worth pinning
here -- that a re-ingest does not duplicate, that an already-recorded target is
skipped -- are enforced by the composite unique index and by presence queries, and
a fake would just re-implement (and possibly contradict) both.
