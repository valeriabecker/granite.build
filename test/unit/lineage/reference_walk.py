"""An independent re-derivation of the lineage traversal, for cross-checking.

Written against the *specification* rather than against ``walk.py``, and
deliberately in a different style: this one materializes the whole edge list and
runs a textbook BFS with a queue, where the implementation batches a frontier per
level and queries storage. Two implementations agreeing is only evidence if they
do not share structure.

The specification it encodes:

1. A row is ``(job_id, source, target)``; ``source``/``target`` are artifact
   identifiers, or the terminal marker for a creation/deletion.
2. Descendants: from node X, follow rows whose ``source`` is X, arriving at their
   ``target``. Ancestors: the mirror.
3. A row that is reached is part of the result, terminals and self-loops included.
4. A terminal is not followed: there is nothing beyond it.
5. A self-loop row is not chained through.
6. A node's reported depth is the length of its shortest path from a seed.
7. ``both`` is the union of the two directions, with each row counted once and
   each node keeping its shorter depth.
8. Exceeding a limit marks the result truncated.

The prototype's own cross-check compares only key sets, not depths -- a gap its
docstring admits. Depth is exactly what property 6 promises, so this reference
returns it and the tests assert on it.
