"""Tests for the lineage graph traversal.

The cross-check tests compare against ``reference_walk``, an independent
re-derivation written against the specification. They assert on ``(node, depth)``
pairs, not just which nodes were reached: the prototype's equivalent check compares
only key sets and skips depths -- a gap its own docstring admits -- and depth is
precisely what "shortest path" promises.
