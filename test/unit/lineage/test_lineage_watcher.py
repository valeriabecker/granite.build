"""Unit tests for the LineageWatcher async lineage-recording agent.

The watcher drives admin-DB reconciliation (see ``lineage_reconciler``) on an
interval; these tests stub the admin storage and the lineage store, then drive
``_reconcile`` directly (bypassing the background thread). They run in CI without
a cluster, PostgreSQL, or wandb credentials.

They cover that the watcher records successful targets, advances its
``finished_at`` watermark so steady-state scans read only newly-finished
targets, does not re-record what a sink already has (per-sink
``filter_unrecorded``), retries a transiently-failing target, and drops a
persistently failing one after ``_MAX_RECORD_ATTEMPTS`` so it cannot wedge later
scans.
