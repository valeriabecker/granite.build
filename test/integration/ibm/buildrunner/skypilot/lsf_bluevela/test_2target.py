"""Two bash-step targets on BlueVela LSF (via Skypilot).

`first` runs the generic `bash` step to echo an output file onto the shared
filesystem and register it as artifact `out1`; `second` binds `first.out1` as an
input, reads it, and registers its own output `out2`. This exercises cross-target
output -> input binding over the env_local (shared-FS) assetstore on BlueVela.

The fixture's build.yaml and buildtest.yaml live in the directory returned by
_get_yaml_spec_dir below.
