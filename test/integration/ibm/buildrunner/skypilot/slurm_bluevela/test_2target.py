"""Two bash-step targets on BlueVela SLURM (via Skypilot) with hf:// I/O.

`first` runs the generic `command` step against the BlueVela SLURM
environment (space://environments/skypilot/slurm/bluevela, provided by the remote
gb-test space — see the naming note in docs/environments/skypilot-slurm.md): it pulls an hf://
dataset input, writes a real output file on the allocated compute node, and
registers it as artifact `out1` — which is pushed to an hf:// dataset repo.
`second` binds `first.out1` as an input (so buildrunner hf-pulls first's output),
reads the bound path, and registers its own hf:// output `out2`. This exercises
cross-target output -> input binding over REAL HuggingFace pulls/pushes. Both
targets run INSIDE a container image (`command_config.image` set → image_id
docker:<image>), the SLURM containerized path that needs the Pyxis SPANK plugin
BlueVela provides.

Because the hf:// URIs drive live HuggingFace pulls/pushes (real files, real
uploads to ibm-research), this is @extended_testing_only and needs HF_TOKEN with
write access to the output repos.

The fixture's build.yaml and buildtest.yaml live in the directory returned by
_get_yaml_spec_dir below.

# NOTE: to validate SSH auth against a freshly edited key/credential, set

# otherwise reuses a persisted SSH ControlMaster socket keyed on
# (host, port, user), not the key, masking an edited cluster_ssh_config for the
# ControlPersist window. This is intentionally NOT an autouse fixture: the
# socket clear globs the whole per-user root (/tmp/skypilot_ssh_<hash>/*/*), so
# forcing it on every run could yank the ControlMaster socket of another
# skypilot build (e.g. an AWS test) running in parallel on a different xdist
# group. Leave it unset for normal runs (the key is unchanged); set it manually
# only when testing a credential change.
