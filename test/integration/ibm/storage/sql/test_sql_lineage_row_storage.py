"""Storage-level tests for lineage rows against a real SQL (postgres) backend.

The behavioural half of this file is deliberately a subclass of the SQLite tests
in ``test/unit/storage/sqlite/test_sqlite_lineage_row_storage.py``: those bodies
are backend-agnostic, and re-running them here is what proves the two backends
agree. ``SqliteLineageRowStorage`` is ``SqliteStorageOverrides +
SQLLineageRowStorage``, so everything the overrides touch -- connection specs,
DDL dialect, index introspection -- is untested on postgres until it runs here.

What only postgres can prove, and so is written fresh below:

- The schema assertions. The SQLite tests read ``sqlite_master`` and
  ``PRAGMA table_info``; neither exists here, so indexes come from ``pg_indexes``
  and column types from ``information_schema.columns``.
- **Index name truncation.** ``__get_unique_index_ddl`` hashes any index name
  over 63 characters into ``uq_<sha1[:7]>_<suffix>`` because that is postgres's
  identifier limit (``sql_storage.py:388-393``). SQLite has no such limit, so the
  truncation branch is only ever reached here -- and a table_name_prefix in a real
  deployment is what pushes a name over it.
- **The composite unique under a real dialect.** The unique index is created with
  the table and can never be added later, so a postgres deployment that gets this
  wrong is not repairable in place.

Marked ``ibm`` and gated on ``SKIP_SQL_ADMIN_TESTS`` to match every other test in
this directory: it needs a reachable postgres and creates real tables.
