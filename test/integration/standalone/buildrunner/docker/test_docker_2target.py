"""Integration test for cross-target mem:// binding on the Docker environment.

Two docker `command`-step targets: the first emits an
`GB_ARTIFACT_ID:… GB_ARTIFACT_STATE:…` marker (a mem:// output), the second
binds it and asserts the value arrived verbatim via the mem:// store — proving
the docker monitor now recognizes the STATE marker and mem:// bindings work on
the docker backend. Mirrors the bash mem 2-target test. The Docker daemon must
be available.

The fixture's build.yaml and buildtest.yaml live in the directory returned by
_get_yaml_spec_dir below.
