"""PII redaction on skypilot/slurm, through the same `dpk` step as tokenization.

**This test exists to prove the step is general.** The sibling
``test/slurm-tok/test_skypilot_slurm_dpk_tok.py`` already shows tokenization working; this
one runs an unrelated DPK transform — ``pii_redactor``, which shares no code, no
flags, and no dependencies with tokenization — and the only things that differ are
in the build.yaml: ``transform``, ``args``, and the artifact names.
``step-template.yaml`` is untouched.

Reaching SUCCESS therefore demonstrates the two derivations hold for a second
transform:

* module — ``transform: pii_redactor`` → ``python -m dpk_pii_redactor.runtime``
* pip    — → ``data-prep-toolkit-transforms[pii-redactor]==<dpk_version>``

so adding transform #3 (and #31) is a build.yaml change, never a step change.

**This is the slow one.** The ``[pii-redactor]`` extra resolves to 125 packages
including torch, flair, and presidio (with numpy pinned below 1.29 by DPK's own
constraint), and the transform downloads a flair NER model on first use. Locally
the install alone took several minutes, so the fixture allows 60. It is the
strongest argument for supporting a prebaked ``dpk_config.dpk_image`` later; an image
is deliberately not used here so the fixture stays credential-free and runs on the
local cluster, which has no Pyxis.

Single target — a generality proof, not a handoff test. Nor does any other fixture
test the handoff: this docstring used to say the tokenization one did, which is false
(see the note in ``test-data/slurm-tok/build.yaml`` and README.md's Known gaps).

Real-infra test, gated on a reachable Docker SLURM cluster, so it auto-skips in CI
and on machines without one (``make test-setup``). Extended suite only.
