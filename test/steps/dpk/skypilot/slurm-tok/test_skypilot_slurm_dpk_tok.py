"""DPK tokenization with in-step validation on skypilot/slurm.

One target. ``transform: tokenization2arrow`` is the only DPK detail the build
gives — the step derives the python module and the pip extra — and
``validate: true`` is the only thing it says about checking the result. The step
finds ``src/validate_tokenization2arrow.py`` by the ``validate_<transform>.py``
rule and runs it on the node after the transform and *before* emitting the
artifact marker, so reaching SUCCESS proves:

* the derivations work against real DPK, not just in the render tests;
* the validator ran and accepted the output — a failure would fail the target and
  register nothing;
* ``validation.json`` was written into the registered output directory.

One target rather than two: the flag removes the need for a downstream target that
binds this output just to check it. That also means this fixture no longer covers the
cross-node ``env:///shared`` handoff — the sibling build.yaml records where to look if
a handoff regression is ever suspected.

Input is a public ``hf://`` dataset, so no HF_TOKEN is needed — the launcher's
``hf download`` runs anonymously.

Real-infra test, gated on a reachable Docker SLURM cluster, so it auto-skips in CI
and on machines without one (``make test-setup`` brings up SLURM + MinIO). Extended
suite only.

The fixture's build.yaml and buildtest.yaml live in the directory returned by
``_get_yaml_spec_dir`` below, resolved by the repo's ``test/`` <-> ``test-data/``
helper so the same file works in both test modes (see steps/README.md).
