## Compute environment

With `default_cloud: slurm`, SkyPilot provisions onto an existing **SLURM** cluster. It reaches the
cluster over **SSH** (login node), submits the job to a partition, and runs the step on the allocated
compute node. gbserver materializes the SSH reachability config from the environment.yaml at launch
time, so the environment asset fully describes how to reach the cluster.

To stand up a local SLURM cluster for development and integration testing, see
[skypilot-slurm-setup.md](setup/skypilot-slurm-setup.md).

## SLURM-specific configuration

### `cluster_ssh_configs.slurm` — reachability

SkyPilot's SLURM provisioner reads `~/.slurm/config` (OpenSSH format). Inline the host entries and
gbserver materializes that file at launch:

```yaml
config:
  default_cloud: slurm
  cluster_ssh_configs:
    slurm:
      - Host: slurm-docker          # Cluster alias SkyPilot references (always literal).
        HostName: 127.0.0.1         # Each non-Host directive value is secret-name-or-literal.
        User: root
        Port: 2222
        IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/slurm_docker_key   # Path to a key already on the host.
        StrictHostKeyChecking: "no"
        UserKnownHostsFile: /dev/null
```

Keys are the **exact OpenSSH directive names**, so the env mirrors `~/.slurm/config` 1:1. Use either
`IdentityFile` (a path to a key already on the host) **or** `IdentityKey` (the key *contents*, typically
via a secret — gbserver writes a `0600` file and points `IdentityFile` at it); specifying both is an
error. The SSH private key and the cluster itself stay out-of-band — gbserver does not provision them.

gbserver merges this block into `~/.slurm/config` with last-writer-wins semantics: a differing
gbserver-managed block for the same alias is **overwritten** (so a stale or re-keyed entry self-heals
— no manual `rm ~/.slurm/config`); a *foreign* (non-gbserver) entry for the same alias is refused
(`SkypilotConfigCollisionError`) — gbserver never clobbers user-owned entries.
See [Inline SkyPilot config](skypilot.md#inline-skypilot-config-cluster_ssh_configs--cloud_config--aws_credentials).

> **Re-keying caveat (test-only `GBTEST_SKY_SSH_RESET`).** Even after `~/.slurm/config` self-heals,
> SkyPilot reuses a persisted SSH ControlMaster socket keyed on `(host, port, user)` — **not** the key
> — so a changed `IdentityFile`/`IdentityKey` can be masked by a live connection until its
> `ControlPersist` window expires (300s, or up to 1 day on the interactive-auth path). To validate a
> credential change against a freshly edited key, set `GBTEST_SKY_SSH_RESET=true` in gbserver's
> environment: on each HPC launch gbserver then clears the persisted control sockets first, forcing
> re-authentication with the current key. This is a **test-only** toggle (manually set, unconditional
> — not idle-gated); production never clears sockets, since the socket root is shared by all of the OS
> user's SkyPilot SSH connections. It is not an environment-config key.

### `cluster` / `zone`

- `cluster` is composed into `infra=slurm/<cluster>` for steps that don't set their own
  `resources.infra`.
- `zone` maps to the SLURM **partition** (submitted via `--partition`), composed as
  `infra=slurm/<cluster>/<zone>`. It is **omitted entirely when unset**, letting SLURM pick the
  cluster's default partition. A `zone` set **without** a `cluster` is rejected with a clear
  error: SkyPilot's `cloud/region/zone` grammar cannot place a partition without a cluster, so a
  bare `zone` would otherwise be silently mislabeled as the cluster — set a `cluster` too.

Both are resolved with the following precedence (highest first), so the partition can be set at
whichever layer is most convenient:

1. `resources.infra` on the step launcher — an explicit full infra string wins outright.
2. `resources.cluster` / `resources.zone` on the step launcher (from `step.yaml`, or `build.yaml`
   `config.launcher_config.resources`).
3. `cluster` / `zone` as plain top-level keys in the step/build `config` (e.g. a `zone:` in
   `build.yaml`).
4. `cluster` / `zone` in this `environment.yaml` `config`.

This precedence is implemented in `Skypilot._resolve_infra_and_zone` and applies to the HPC
clouds (`slurm` and `lsf` — see [skypilot-lsf.md](skypilot-lsf.md); non-HPC clouds consult only
the step launcher's `resources`). For a real-cluster example, the SLURM/BlueVela integration
fixtures under `test-data/integration/ibm/buildrunner/skypilot/slurm_bluevela/` target BlueVela's
`gpu-mid` partition (reached at `login1`) via the `bluevela` environment.

> **The `bluevela` environment lives in a remote space, not this repo.** Those fixtures resolve
> `space://environments/skypilot/slurm/bluevela` against a remote space (e.g. `gb-test`), which is
> why `bluevela` isn't found anywhere in this tree. That environment sets `cluster: bluevela`,
> `zone: gpu-mid`, a shared `shared_workdir`, and the `cloud_config` workdir mapping described
> below, and authenticates to the SLURM login node with an SSH key (an on-host
> `~/.ssh/ibm-bluevela.key`, or a `BV_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret in the space).

#### Override the partition (`zone`) per build

To run a target on a different partition than its environment declares, set `zone` in the build's
step `config` — no `environment.yaml` change needed. Either build-level layer above works. Because a
`zone` without a `cluster` is rejected (see above), also supply a `cluster` unless the environment
already sets one (it does for `bluevela`).

Layer 2 — under `launcher_config.resources` (wins over a top-level `zone`):

```yaml
# build.yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    environment_uri: space://environments/skypilot/slurm/bluevela
    steps:
      - step_uri: space://steps/command
        config:
          launcher_config:
            resources:
              zone: gpu-high        # override the env's gpu-mid partition
              # cluster: bluevela   # only if the environment doesn't already set one
```

Layer 3 — a plain top-level `zone` in the step `config` (shorter; overridden by any
`launcher_config.resources.zone`):

```yaml
        config:
          zone: gpu-high            # override the partition
```

### Autostop is ignored

SLURM does not support cluster autostop, so gbserver forces `idle_minutes_to_autostop=None` on the
`slurm` cloud — any value you set is ignored. Per-step `cleanup_skypilot()` runs `sky down` after each
step, which releases the node allocation. If you queue more parallel steps than the cluster has nodes,
the surplus stay PENDING until earlier ones finish and free a node.

### No `image_id` on bare-host clusters

Setting `image_id` on a launcher runs the job in a container, which on SLURM **requires the Pyxis SPANK
plugin**. On a bare-host SLURM cluster (including the local Docker fixture), omit `image_id` or the
launch fails with `NotSupportedError`; the `run:` command then executes directly on the compute node.

> **Container images must be Debian/Ubuntu-based (apt).** When running in a container, SkyPilot
> bootstraps its in-container SSH shim with `apt-get`, so only Debian-based images are supported (see
> the SkyPilot [Docker containers docs](https://docs.skypilot.ai/en/latest/examples/docker-containers.html)).
> A non-Debian image (e.g. a Fedora/RPM `quay.io/fedora/...` image) pulls fine but fails during job
> setup — enroot launches it, the `apt-get` step exits non-zero, and the failure surfaces only as a
> generic `ResourcesUnavailableError: Failed to acquire resources in <partition>`. Confirm with
> `sacct -j <job_id> --format=JobID,State,ExitCode,Reason`: the container-setup sub-steps show
> `FAILED 1:0` while the host-side steps complete. The image must also grant passwordless `sudo` (or run
> as root).

### `workdir` (containerized steps)

A containerized step (`command_config.image` set) runs its `run:` inside an enroot container whose
filesystem is **not** the compute node's. The SkyPilot SLURM backend bind-mounts only three host paths
into that container — the account home, the ccache dir, and the SkyPilot **`workdir`**
([`sky/provision/slurm/instance.py`](https://github.com/cmadam/skypilot/blob/5f18669dc9985f0649147dbcc6bb79d89aeb428d/sky/provision/slurm/instance.py)
in the granite-build SkyPilot fork pinned by `pyproject.toml`
builds `--container-mounts` as `home:home`, `ccache:ccache`, and `workdir:workdir`, the last only when
`workdir` is set and differs from home). It does **not** identity-mount `/proj` (that is the LSF
backend, not this one). So unless `shared_workdir` falls under a mounted path, the per-run
`$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR` does not exist inside the container: the launcher's `cd "$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR"`
`mkdir`s it in the container's ephemeral writable overlay, the step writes its output there, the overlay
is discarded at teardown, and the separate bare `hfpush` step then fails with `out does not exist` (or
`<path> does not exist`).

**Fix:** set the SkyPilot `workdir` to an ancestor of (or equal to) `shared_workdir` via the
environment's `cloud_config` block, which is deep-merged into `~/.sky/config.yaml` at launch. The key
path is `slurm.cluster_configs.<cluster>.workdir` (`<cluster>` is the `cluster:` name):

```yaml
config:
  shared_workdir: /proj/data-eng/llmb-read-write/builds/
  cloud_config:
    slurm:
      cluster_configs:
        bluevela:                                    # must match config.cluster
          workdir: /proj/data-eng/llmb-read-write/builds   # ancestor of shared_workdir
```

With this, the enroot container mounts `/proj/data-eng/llmb-read-write/builds` identity, the container's
`cd "$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR"` lands on the real shared filesystem, and a relative output path (e.g. `out/`)
is visible to the downstream `hfpush`. No `build.yaml` change is needed.

Constraints and notes:

- **`workdir` must be an ancestor of (or equal to) `shared_workdir`** so the derived
  `$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR = <shared_workdir>/builds/<build_id>/runs/<targetrun_id>/` falls inside the
  `workdir:workdir` bind mount.
- **`workdir` must not equal the account home** (`remote_home_dir`); when it does, the backend adds no
  extra mount and the fix is inert.
- **Bare steps don't need this** — they run on the host and see `shared_workdir` directly. `workdir` is
  only required once a step runs in a container.
- **Side effect:** SkyPilot relocates its cluster home to `<workdir>/.sky_clusters/<cluster>`. This is
  benign and does not collide with gbserver's `<shared_workdir>/builds/...` run tree.
- This mirrors LSF's `cloud_config.lsf.cluster_configs.<cluster>.workdir`, but LSF does **not** require
  the ancestor relationship because its backend identity-mounts all of `/proj` (see
  [skypilot-lsf.md](skypilot-lsf.md#file_mounts-inside-enroot-containers)).

## Example `environment.yaml` (bare-host SLURM)

This is the pattern used by the
[`skypilot_slurm` integration test](../../test/integration/standalone/buildrunner/skypilot_slurm/)
against the local Docker SLURM cluster from [skypilot-slurm-setup.md](setup/skypilot-slurm-setup.md). No
`image_id` is set because the local cluster has no Pyxis plugin.

```yaml
name: slurm-local
type: Skypilot
config:
  default_cloud: slurm
  cluster: slurm-docker
  zone: normal                  # SLURM partition.
  idle_minutes_to_autostop: 0   # Ignored on SLURM; per-step `sky down` handles teardown.
  shared_workdir: /shared       # Path shared across slurmctld/c1/c2 in the local Docker fixture.
                                # HF cache defaults to /shared/hf_cache via this declaration.
  cluster_ssh_configs:
    slurm:
      - Host: slurm-docker
        HostName: 127.0.0.1
        User: root
        Port: 2222
        IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/slurm_docker_key
        StrictHostKeyChecking: "no"
        UserKnownHostsFile: /dev/null
assetstores:
  - store_uri: space://assetstores/hf
    pull:
      - mode: default
    push:
      - mode: default
```

A `command` step on this env runs directly on the compute node when no image is
given (leave `command_config.image` empty so `image_id` resolves to empty and the
launcher runs on the bare node; set it to run inside a container instead):

```yaml
environment_configs:
  Skypilot:
    default_launcher: command
    launchers:
      command:
        type: skypilot
        monitors:
          - skypilot_monitor
        config:
          # image_id resolves to "" when command_config.image is empty — runs
          # directly on the SLURM compute node.
          image_id: '{{ ("docker:" ~ config.command_config.image) if config.command_config.image else "" }}'
          resources:
            cpus: "1+"
            memory: "1+"
          run: |
            {{ config.command_config.command }}
    monitors:
      # References the shipped monitor library (builtins/monitors/skypilot) as-is —
      # no inline event rules to maintain. It carries the standard GB_ARTIFACT_*
      # convention (GB_ markers, with the legacy LLMB_ prefix dual-accepted, and the
      # `binding` field) plus the default poll/log_retrieval profile; a build.yaml step
      # `config.poll_interval_seconds` flows through the monitor's own `| default(...)`
      # template (see the `command` step at
      # src/gbserver/builtins/steps/skypilot/command/step.yaml).
      skypilot_monitor:
        ref: space://monitors/skypilot
```
