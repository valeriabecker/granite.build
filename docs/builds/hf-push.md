# HuggingFace URIs and Output Push Configuration

This document covers two related things:

1. The **`hf://` URI scheme** (`HfURI`) used throughout `build.yaml` to identify
   HuggingFace models, datasets, spaces, and buckets.
2. The **`store_push` block** on a target output, which controls how a completed
   artifact is pushed to the HuggingFace Hub.

> **TL;DR:** You almost never need `store_push`. An `hf://` URI on the output is
> enough — the environment's asset store and the active g.b space supply the
> defaults (private repo, and — for HF Enterprise orgs — a space-derived
> resource group). To publish a single output, add `public: true` next to its
> `uri`. Reach for the full `store_push` block only for resource-group overrides.

---

## HuggingFace URI format

`HfURI` (`src/gbcommon/uri/hf.py`) parses URIs in the following shape:

```
hf://[<host>/][<type>/]<owner>/<repo>[/<revision>[/<path_in_repo>]]
```

| Segment | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `host` | `huggingface.co` | Omit (double `//`) to use the default; supply a host to target an Enterprise or custom hub. |
| `type` | `models` (implicit) | One of `models`, `datasets`, `spaces`, `buckets`. The `models/` segment may be omitted. |
| `owner` | — | Required. HF organization or user. |
| `repo` | — | Required. Repository name. |
| `revision` | `main` | Branch, tag, or commit SHA. |
| `path_in_repo` | `""` (repo root) | Subpath within the repo. If present, `revision` must be explicit (otherwise the parser cannot tell revision from path). |

### Examples

```yaml
# Models — "models/" segment is optional
hf:///mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3                       # implicit MODEL, default host
hf:///models/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3                # explicit MODEL
hf://huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3  # explicit host
hf://ibm.com/models/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3         # custom host
hf:///ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct/v1.0                 # explicit revision
hf:///ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct/main/config.json     # revision + path_in_repo

# Datasets
hf://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext/wikitext-103-v1
hf:///datasets/org/my-dataset
hf:///datasets/org/my-dataset/v2/data/train.csv                # revision + path_in_repo

# Spaces
hf://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/diffusers-gallery

# Buckets
hf://huggingface.co/buckets/org/test-bucket1
```

### Jinja templating in URIs

URIs in `build.yaml` can use Jinja expressions against the build context:

```yaml
outputs:
  download_file:
    uri: hf://huggingface.co/datasets/my-org/run-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
```

`binding`, `run_metadata`, and the space variables are available. The rendered URI
is then parsed as `HfURI`.

---

## Minimal `build.yaml` — no `store_push` needed

For most builds an `hf://` URI on the output is all you need:

```yaml
llm.build:
  targets:
    publish_dataset:
      outputs:
        out:
          uri: hf://huggingface.co/datasets/my-org/my-dataset-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
      steps:
        - step_uri: space://steps/download
          config: { ... }
```

With the above, the framework will:
- Derive the HF repo **type** (`dataset`) from the URI.
- Use `private: true` by default (inherited from the environment or the built-in default).
- Attach a resource group derived from the active g.b space (`gbspace-<space>`) **when the target org is an HF Enterprise org**, so pushes into Enterprise-gated namespaces like `ibm-research` work out of the box. Pushes to a non-Enterprise org (an individual user namespace, say) skip resource groups entirely — see [Enterprise vs non-Enterprise organizations](#enterprise-vs-non-enterprise-organizations).

**Use `store_push` only when you need to override one of these defaults for a single output.**

---

## Making an output public

Outputs are private by default. To publish one, set `public: true` on the output
— no `store_push` block, no `mode`:

```yaml
outputs:
  download_file:
    uri: hf://huggingface.co/datasets/myaccount/my-dataset-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
    public: true
```

`public` is a boolean, **default `false`** (private). Only an explicit truthy
value (`true`/`yes`/`on`/`1`, quoted or not) publishes; anything else — omitted,
`false`, an empty/`null` value, or an unrecognized typo — keeps the repo private.
That fail-closed rule is deliberate: HuggingFace's own `create_repo` defaults to
*public*, so a mis-set flag must never silently publish an artifact.

`public` may also be written inside the push config, next to the resource-group
keys, if you are already using a `store_push` block. Both forms mean the same thing:

```yaml
public: true                          # top-level (preferred)
store_push: { config: { hf: { public: true } } }
```

Setting both on the same output with **conflicting** values is an error (it is
almost always a copy-paste mistake); equal values are fine.

> `public` is HuggingFace-only. Setting it (or any `store_push.config.hf.*` key)
> on a non-`hf://` output — `lh://`, `env://`, `file://`, `cos://` — fails
> validation at load time, since those stores have no notion of repo visibility.

### `public` vs HuggingFace's `private`

granite.build's surface flag is `public` (default false); HuggingFace's API uses
`private` (`create_repo(private=...)`, `hf upload --private`). The two are the
same setting inverted, and the inversion happens at exactly one place —
[`_private_from_hf_cfg`](../../src/gbserver/spaces/hf_push_config.py), where the
merged push config is resolved. Everything below that point (the resolver's
return value, the emitted step config, the LSF/Helm/SkyPilot worker templates,
and `gbcommon.uri.hf`) speaks `private`, matching the HF API; everything you
write in `build.yaml`/`store.yaml` speaks `public`. You never write `private`.

The former `store_push.config.hf.private` key is retired: it is rejected at load
time with an error pointing to `public` (`private: false` becomes `public: true`),
so an old config fails loudly rather than silently reverting to private.

---

## The optional `store_push` block

The full block is only needed for resource-group overrides (for `public`, prefer
the top-level form above):

```yaml
llm.build:
  targets:
    <target-name>:
      outputs:
        <output-name>:
          uri: hf://huggingface.co/datasets/<org>/<repo>
          public: true                            # optional; publishes the repo
          store_push:                # <-- optional, omit when defaults suffice
            config:
              hf:
                resource_group_id: "abc123..."        # or use resource_group_name
                resource_group_name: "gbspace-public"
```

`mode` may be set but is not needed — the store is inferred from the `hf://` URI
scheme, and `mode` is honored only by k8s (ignored, with a deprecation warning,
elsewhere).

`store_push` is evaluated per-output and **takes precedence** over any equivalent
settings in `environment.yaml` (see [Relationship with `environment.yaml`](#relationship-with-environmentyaml)).

### Fields

#### `mode`

Optional and rarely needed. The store is inferred from the output `uri` scheme
(`hf://` → the HF store); `mode` is honored only by the k8s environment and
ignored — with a deprecation warning — everywhere else. Prefer omitting it (or
`"default"`).

If `store_push` is absent the environment-level push configuration from `environment.yaml`
is used instead (see the [environments overview](../environments/README.md)).

#### `config` and `config.hf`

All fields are optional.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `public` | bool | `false` | Whether the HuggingFace repository should be **public**. Default (and any non-truthy/unrecognized value) → private. May be written as top-level `public` or `config.hf.public` — see [Making an output public](#making-an-output-public). |
| `resource_group_id` | string | — | Pre-resolved HF Enterprise resource group id. When provided, no HF API lookup is performed — the id is used as-is. Enterprise orgs only — supplying it for a non-Enterprise org is an error. |
| `resource_group_name` | string | — | Resource group name. Resolved to an id via the HF API at push time. Enterprise orgs only. |
| `use_resource_group` | bool | `true` | Set to `false` to push to an Enterprise org **without** a resource group. Cannot be combined with `resource_group_id`/`resource_group_name`. See [Enterprise vs non-Enterprise organizations](#enterprise-vs-non-enterprise-organizations). |

The HuggingFace **repo type** (`model`, `dataset`, `space`) is not configurable here — it
is derived automatically from the `uri` scheme (e.g. `hf:///datasets/…` → `dataset`).

---

## Enterprise vs non-Enterprise organizations

Resource groups are an **HF Enterprise** feature. Pushing into an Enterprise-gated
namespace like `ibm-research` requires a resource group id; pushing into an
individual user namespace (`my-user/my-model`) or a plain community org has no
resource group at all.

There is no non-admin HF API that tells the two apart, so the split is
**configuration-driven**. The `hf` asset store's `store.yaml` lists the orgs that
use Enterprise resource groups:

```yaml
# assetstores/hf/store.yaml
base_uri: "hf:/"
config:
  token_secretname: HF_TOKEN
  enterprise_organizations:
    - ibm-research
    - ibm-granite
```

| Push target | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Org **in** `enterprise_organizations` | A resource group is resolved (see [Resource group resolution](#resource-group-resolution)). Unchanged from before. |
| Org **not in** the list | Resource group resolution is **skipped entirely** — no space lookup, no HF API call. Pinning a resource group is an error. |
| Key **absent** | Every org is treated as Enterprise. This is the pre-split behavior, kept for backward compatibility. |
| Key present but empty (`[]`) | No org is treated as Enterprise. |

Matching is a case-insensitive **exact** match on the org name. There is no glob
or wildcard support — `ibm-*` matches nothing, and `"*"` is a literal name.

### Setting this for a remote space

`store.yaml` is loaded server-side from the space's git repo, so for a remote
space, edit `assetstores/hf/store.yaml` **in that space repo** and add the
`enterprise_organizations` key shown above. There is no CLI or API to set it.

> **Two places to keep in sync.** The CLI (`gb artifact push/register --store hf`)
> cannot read `store.yaml` — it is server-side only — so it reads the same list
> from `hf_enterprise_organizations` in
> [`src/gbcommon/types/gbenvconfig.py`](../../src/gbcommon/types/gbenvconfig.py).
> When you change one, change the other.

### Opting an Enterprise org out

An org that *is* in the list can still push without a resource group by setting
`use_resource_group: false`:

```yaml
outputs:
  scratch_model:
    uri: hf://huggingface.co/ibm-research/scratch-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
    store_push:
      mode: "hfstore"
      config:
        hf:
          use_resource_group: false
```

Combining it with an explicit `resource_group_id`/`resource_group_name` **in the
same push config** is contradictory and raises `ValueError`. Across levels the
higher one wins, per the priority table above:

| `environment.yaml` push | output `store_push` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `resource_group_name: …` | `use_resource_group: false` | No resource group — the per-output opt-out wins, which is what makes it usable when the environment supplies a group as the level-3 fallback. |
| `use_resource_group: false` | `resource_group_id: …` | That id — an output-level pin is priority 1, so it re-enables resource groups over an inherited opt-out. |
| `use_resource_group: false` | `use_resource_group: true` | Resource group resolved from the space. |
| `use_resource_group: false` | *(nothing)* | No resource group. |

### Errors

Pinning a resource group for a non-Enterprise org fails the push:

```
Resource group 'gbspace-public' was configured for HuggingFace organization
'my-user', but 'my-user' is not an HF Enterprise organization. Resource groups
apply only to Enterprise organizations. Remove
store_push.config.hf.resource_group_id / resource_group_name, or add 'my-user'
to enterprise_organizations in the hf asset store's store.yaml.
```

The CLI reports the equivalent for `--resource-group-id`.

> Pulling is unaffected by any of this. `hf` downloads never use a resource
> group — only the HF token's access matters.

---

## Resource group resolution

The effective resource-group id is determined with the following priority
(highest → lowest). Only one source needs to be set; when multiple are set they
must agree (the resolver raises `ValueError` on mismatch).

| Priority | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 0 | **Enterprise check** (`store.yaml` → `config.enterprise_organizations`) | Evaluated *first*. If the URI's org is not an Enterprise org, everything below is skipped and no resource group is attached. An Enterprise org with `use_resource_group: false` is likewise skipped. See [Enterprise vs non-Enterprise organizations](#enterprise-vs-non-enterprise-organizations). |
| 1 | `store_push.config.hf.resource_group_id` (build.yaml) | Per-output pre-resolved id. No HF API call. |
| 2 | `store_push.config.hf.resource_group_name` (build.yaml) | Per-output name. Resolved via HF API. |
| 3 | `environment.yaml` → `assetstores[].push[].config.hf.resource_group_id` / `resource_group_name` | Environment-level fallback. |
| 4 | Build `space_name` (automatic) | Populated at runtime from the g.b space. The server first uses the `hf_default_resource_group_id` **cached on the space row** (`gb_spaces` table); if absent, the space name is converted to a resource group name by prepending `gbspace-` and resolved via the HF API, then the resolved id is written back onto the space row. Only the space's **default** group is cached — an explicit `resource_group_name` for a *different* group bypasses the cache and is resolved (and cross-checked) via the HF API without being cached. This is the default that makes `store_push` unnecessary in most cases. |

If none of the above yield a value, no resource group is attached to the push.

> **Note**: `space_name` is **not** a field you set in `build.yaml` — it is
> populated at runtime from the g.b space the build belongs to. It appears here
> only because it contributes to the final resource-group resolution.

> **Why the space-table cache?** The HF API that maps a resource group *name* to
> its *id* (`GET /api/organizations/{org}/resource-groups`) only lists groups the
> caller can *manage* — effectively org-admin scope. A `contributor`/`write` user
> cannot resolve the id even though they can push to the group. Caching the id on

> lookup) lets non-admin CLI users and standalone servers resolve it without an

> re-verified at runtime.

The space-table lookup + HF fallback + write-back is implemented in
[`resolve_space_resource_group_id`](../../src/gbserver/spaces/hf_push_config.py),
which wraps the HF-only resolver
[`HfURI.resolve_resource_group_id_for_org`](../../src/gbcommon/uri/hf.py). It is
called from the K8s, LSF, and SkyPilot push paths (and the CLI-facing
`/hf/resource-group` endpoint) before the step is dispatched.

## Override examples (when `store_push` *is* needed)

### Make a single output public

```yaml
outputs:
  download_file:
    uri: hf://huggingface.co/datasets/my-org/my-dataset-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
    public: true
```

See [Making an output public](#making-an-output-public) for the other accepted
forms.

### Pin a specific resource group name (ignore the space default)

```yaml
outputs:
  tuned_model:
    uri: hf://huggingface.co/my-org/tuned-model-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
    store_push:
      mode: "hfstore"
      config:
        hf:
          resource_group_name: "research-team"
```

### Pin a pre-resolved resource group id

Use when you've already looked up the id out-of-band and want to skip the HF API
call at push time:

```yaml
outputs:
  tuned_model:
    uri: hf://huggingface.co/my-org/tuned-model-{{ binding.path | short_hash }}
    store_push:
      mode: "hfstore"
      config:
        hf:
          resource_group_id: "5f8a...2c4"
```

---

## Relationship with `environment.yaml`

The environment asset store may also declare a `push` block under `assetstores`:

```yaml
assetstores:
  - store_uri: hf://huggingface.co/my-org
    pull:
      - mode: default
    push:
      - config:
          hf:
            public: false            # the default; shown for illustration
            resource_group_name: "default-group"
```

`public` at the environment level is written as `config.hf.public` (there is no
output-level field here); it defaults to `false` (private), so you only set it to
opt a whole environment's pushes into public.

Fields in `build.yaml`'s `store_push` **override** the corresponding fields from the
environment-level push config.  Any field not set in `build.yaml` falls back to the
environment value.
