# Troubleshooting

Concrete failure modes and where to look. If your problem isn't here, the
fastest debug path is usually `gb build status <id>` followed by
`gb build log <id>`, then drilling into the relevant runner's logs.

> **Audience:** anyone running gbserver or submitting builds against one. The
> fixes here assume you can shell into the runner's environment and read
> server logs.

## Build is stuck in `pending`

The BuildWatcher hasn't picked it up. Most common causes:

1. **No watcher running.** `gb build list` shows the build but no runner is
   advancing it.
   - Standalone mode: confirm `gbserver standalone` is still alive in its
     terminal.
   - Production: confirm the buildwatcher pod/process is running.
2. **`GBSERVER_DEFAULT_BUILDRUNNER_TYPE` mismatch.** If the watcher is
   configured for `job` (Kubernetes) but you're running standalone, jobs
   never get dispatched. Set `GBSERVER_DEFAULT_BUILDRUNNER_TYPE=thread` for
   local development.
3. **Filtering by space or label.** The watcher polls a specific space or
   label. Check that your build's space matches what the watcher is
   subscribed to.

## Step fails to start

The runner picks the build up, but the step never produces logs.

- **Image pull failure.** In Kubernetes/Docker, look for `ImagePullBackOff`
  or `Error: pulling image`. Confirm the image exists and the runner has
  pull credentials. See
  [`bring-your-own-image.md`](../steps/bring-your-own-image.md) for the
  pull-secret flow.
- **Missing secret.** Steps that reference an env-mounted secret fail
  immediately if the secret manager doesn't have it. Check
  [`local-secrets-manager.md`](../secrets/local-secrets-manager.md) (standalone) or
  the SPS configuration (production).
- **Bad `environment_uri`.** Spelling or template-resolution errors here
  surface as "environment not found." `gb build describe -f build.yaml`
  shows the resolved URI.

## HuggingFace push returns 403

- The token doesn't have write access to the target org/repo, or
- The resource group isn't resolvable.

See [`builds/hf-push.md`](../builds/hf-push.md) for the URI format and
resource-group resolution rules. Sanity-check with:

```bash
huggingface-cli login --token <your-token>
huggingface-cli whoami
```

## Kubernetes `env` rejected with "must be a STRING"

`BuildTargetStepConfig.validate_k8s_env_section` rejects unquoted integers
in `step.config.k8s.env`. Quote the values:

```yaml
config:
  k8s:
    env:
      NCCL_TIMEOUT:
        value: "10800000"   # not 10800000
```

## SkyPilot doesn't see the SLURM cluster

```bash
sky check slurm
```

If it reports "not configured":

- For the local Docker SLURM cluster, did `make slurm-setup` complete?
  Re-run it. See
  [`skypilot-slurm-setup.md`](../environments/setup/skypilot-slurm-setup.md).
- For a remote cluster, confirm SSH keys and the cluster is in
  `~/.sky/config.yaml`.

## Step retry isn't happening

Step-level retries are gated by `GBSERVER_ENABLE_STEP_RETRY` *and* by the
step's `retry_enabled` flag. Both must be true. See
[`step-retry-configuration.md`](../builds/step-retry-configuration.md) for
the priority chain (build.yaml override → step.yaml default → env-var gate).

Currently only K8s (helm) and LSF (bsub) environments support step-level
retry. Other environments will silently skip retry attempts.

## Standalone mode 401s on remote requests

Localhost-only mode is the default when `GBSERVER_API_KEY` isn't set —
remote requests get 401. Set the same key on both server and client:

```bash
# server
export GBSERVER_API_KEY="my-secret-key"
gbserver standalone --space-dir ...

# client
export GBSERVER_API_KEY="my-secret-key"
gb build start ...
```

## VSCode pytest debugger hangs on a subprocess

Known issue with the VSCode pytest plugin and blocking `subprocess.wait()`
calls in fixtures: the Test Explorer's "Debug Test" button hangs.

Workaround: use a "pytest as module" launch configuration in
`launch.json` (calls `python -m pytest <file>::<test>`) instead of the
plugin's debugger button.

## Capturing state when a build test fails

`test/conftest.py` has a `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook that, on
assertion failures matching `[Build: <id>]` in the message, automatically
appends a JSON dump of the build state to the report. If you're writing
buildtest assertions, format failure messages with `[Build: <id>]` to opt
into this.

The dump is also useful when reproducing a customer's failure: it captures
target/step state at the moment the assertion fired.

## hfpull steps hang (concurrent pulls of the same model)

When several targets pull the same `hf://` model into the shared cache, the
pulls are serialized by a cross-process lock (a `mkdir` lock dir at
`<cache>/<owner>/<repo>/.gb-hfpull-locks/<hash>.lock`, holding a `lock.info` of
`host:...|pid:...` + a start timestamp). If one target finished but the others
stay stuck — and the log repeats `breaking stale lock ...` — a holder failed to
remove its lock. (This happened on object-store/AFM-backed caches where a
directory rename fails; fixed in
[#354](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite.build/issues/354). Older images
still hit it.)

How reclaim works — worth knowing before you touch anything:

- **Reclaim is passive**, driven by the *next* acquirer; there is no background
  sweeper. A crashed holder's lock is broken by the next waiter once it is past
  `GB_HFPULL_LOCK_TIMEOUT` (default **900s / 15 min**) with no writes under the
  holder's HF scratch dir (`<hash>/.cache/huggingface/download/`). The window is
  measured from the dead holder's *last write* and only elapses while a fresh
  waiter is polling — so a crashed pull self-heals on the next pull. Routine
  manual wiping is not required.
- The `.gb-hfpull-locks/` **container** is never removed by design (removing it
  races a peer creating a sibling lock), so one empty container dir persists per
  `<owner>/<repo>/`. That is not a leak.

To clear a stuck lock faster than the 15-min auto-recovery — **only when no
hfpull is running for that repo**:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the recorded holder is dead (and, cross-node, nothing is writing
#    under the sibling <hash>/.cache/huggingface/download/).
cat <cache>/<owner>/<repo>/.gb-hfpull-locks/<hash>.lock/lock.info
# 2. Then remove the lock (waiters grab it within ~1 poll):
rm -rf <cache>/<owner>/<repo>/.gb-hfpull-locks/<hash>.lock
```

Deleting a *live* holder's lock reopens the corruption race from
[#320](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite.build/issues/320) — confirm the
holder is dead first. Tune the window with `GB_HFPULL_LOCK_TIMEOUT` (seconds).

## Where to look when nothing else works

- `gb build status <id>` — high-level state, errors per step.
- `gb build log <id>` — per-step stdout/stderr.
- `gb admin log <module>` — server-side logs for the rest server, build
  watcher, build runner. Requires admin auth.
- For SQL-storage debugging: connect to the gbserver Postgres directly and
  read `gb_builds`, `gb_targets`, `gb_steps`, `gb_artifacts`.
- For SQLite (standalone): the database file is at `~/.granite.build/llmb-server.db`.
- Runner-environment specifics:
  - K8s: `kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod>` for the launcher pod.
  - SkyPilot: `sky logs <cluster>`.
  - RunPod: the RunPod web console — pods are short-lived.

If you've exhausted the above, file an issue at
<https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite.build/issues> with the build ID,
the relevant `gb build status` output, and any logs that mention errors.
