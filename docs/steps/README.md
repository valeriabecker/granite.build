# Steps

A step is the unit of execution within a target. Each target runs one or more
steps in sequence. A step is defined by a `step.yaml` file that declares how
it launches work on a given environment.

> **Audience:** users authoring builds and anyone creating custom steps.

## How steps are referenced

In a `build.yaml`, each step entry has a `step_uri` field:

```yaml
steps:
  - step_uri: space://steps/command
    config:
      command_config:
        command: "python train.py --epochs 3"
```

### URI schemes

| Scheme | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `space://steps/<name>` | `space://steps/command` | Resolves to a step registered in the active space. |
| `file://<path>` | `file://./my-step` | Local directory containing a `step.yaml`. |
| `git+ssh://<repo>#subdirectory=<path>` | `git+ssh://github.com/org/repo.git#subdirectory=steps/custom` | Step from a Git repository. |

If `step_uri` is omitted, the built-in `gbstep` step is used.

## Built-in steps

These steps ship with gbserver in `src/gbserver/builtins/steps/`. Steps intended for
direct reference from a `build.yaml` have a focused reference page (linked below).

| Step | Description | Environments | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| `gbstep` | Base step runner. Default when `step_uri` is omitted. Supports `setup_command`, `start_command`, and `cleanup_command`. | All (Bash, Docker, K8s, LSF, RunPod, Skypilot, Skypilot-managed) | — |
| `command` | Run a shell command; its exit status is the step's status. Docker/Skypilot can run it inside a container image via `command_config.image` (BYOI); Bash always runs on the bare node. | Bash, Docker, Skypilot | [`command`](command.md) |

> The data-staging utility steps `hfpull`/`hfpush` (HuggingFace), `s3pull`/`s3push`
> (S3-compatible stores), and `cosrclone` (rclone-based transfers) are wired in
> automatically to move a target's declared inputs/outputs and are **not** intended
> to be referenced directly from a `build.yaml`, so they are not documented here.

## Bash example steps

These steps ship under `configurations/assets/environments/bash/steps/` and demonstrate
inference and LoRA fine-tuning in the local **bash** environment (no GPU or container
required). See [bash environment](../environments/bash.md) for how a bash step
receives inputs/config and reports outputs.

| Step | Description | Doc |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `inference` | Generate a response to a prompt with any causal LM. | [README](../../configurations/assets/environments/bash/steps/inference/README.md) |
| `inference-lora` | Inference with an optional LoRA adapter (target + control prompt). | [README](../../configurations/assets/environments/bash/steps/inference-lora/README.md) |
| `lora-finetune` | Train a LoRA adapter (synthetic or supplied dataset). | [README](../../configurations/assets/environments/bash/steps/lora-finetune/README.md) |

## `step.yaml` structure

A step definition lives in a directory with a `step.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-step
launchers:
  bash:
    setup_command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    start_command: "python main.py"
    cleanup_command: "rm -rf /tmp/work"
  k8s:
    image: my-registry/my-image:latest
    start_command: "python main.py"
monitors:
  log_monitor:
    ref: space://monitors/bash   # reference a shared monitor from the library (recommended)
    # — or inline it —
    # type: log_monitor          # tails the workload's stdout/stderr
    # config:
    #   event_configs: [ ... ]   # rules that turn log lines into build events
config:
  retry_enabled: false
  retry_transparently: false
```

> A monitor turns matching workload log lines into build events — including the artifact
> events that register a step's outputs. In a full step definition, monitors are declared
> per environment type under `environment_configs`, and usually **reference** a shared monitor
> from the library (`ref: space://monitors/<name>`) instead of inlining the rules; see
> [Monitoring and artifact events](monitoring-and-artifact-events.md) for the real schema, the
> reference/overlay mechanics, and how to capture outputs.

### Key fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Step identifier. |
| `inputs` / `outputs` | Optional I/O schema (`required`/`optional` maps of `name → {type, accept}`, plus `allow_unknown`). Validated against the build's target inputs/outputs before the build runs — a missing required input fails fast. See the [bash example steps](#bash-example-steps) for concrete schemas. |
| `launchers` | Map of environment type → launch config. The environment selects which launcher to use. |
| `monitors` | How gbserver detects step completion and captures outputs by parsing workload logs. See [Monitoring and artifact events](monitoring-and-artifact-events.md). |
| `config` | Default configuration (overridable by the build.yaml `step.config`). |

Each launcher type matches an environment backend (bash, docker, k8s, lsf,
skypilot, runpod). A step can support multiple environments by declaring
multiple launchers.

## Step configuration in build.yaml

The `config` block in a step entry is merged with the step's own defaults:

```yaml
steps:
  - step_uri: space://steps/tuning
    config:
      compute_config:
        num_nodes: 1
        num_gpus_per_node: 4
      tuning_config:
        epochs: 3
        learning_rate: 2e-5
```

See the [`build.yaml` reference](../builds/build-yaml-reference.md#steps)
for the full set of fields.

## Extending with custom steps

Three approaches for running custom code:

| Approach | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| [Bring Your Own Step (BYOS)](bring-your-own-step.md) | Your code lives in a Git repo; you provide setup/start commands. |
| [Custom code steps](custom-code-steps.md) | You want inline commands without a separate step definition. |
| [Bring Your Own Image (BYOI)](bring-your-own-image.md) | You have a pre-built container image. |
